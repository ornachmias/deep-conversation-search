0,0,So please finish
0,1,Percival for next time.
0,2,I know many of you had

0,5,Thank you Steven.
0,6,I also put an advanced
0,7,Fourier system

0,12,Now the person to do so will
0,13,not only be in my good graces...
0,14,but also go on to
0,15,fame and fortune...
0,16,by having their accomplishment
0,17,recorded and their name printed...
0,18,in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.
0,19,Former winners include
0,20,Nobel laureates
0,21,Field's medal winners...
0,22,renowned astrophysicists
0,23,and lowly M.I.T. professors.
0,24,Well that's all.
0,25,If you have any questions...
0,26,I'm sure that Tom
0,27,has the answers.

4,73,Like how you bought your

4,75,Remember how your
4,76,mother brought in

7,3,Easy brother easy.
7,4,Hey fellas thanks for comin' out.
7,5,Come here!
7,6,Whoa! Whoa!
8,0,Ah. Fuck.
9,0,Is it just my imagination
9,1,or has my class
9,2,grown considerably?
9,3,Well by no stretch
9,4,of my imagination...
9,5,do I believe you've all come
9,6,here to hear me lecture.
9,7,Rather to ascertain
9,8,the identity
9,9,of the mystery math magician.
9,10,So without further
9,11,adieu come forward
9,12,silent rogue and
9,13,receive thy prize.
10,0,Well I'm sorry to disappoint
10,1,my spectators but...
10,2,it seems there will be
10,3,no unmasking here today.
10,4,However uh my colleagues
10,5,and I have conferred
10,6,and there is a problem
10,7,on the board right now...
10,8,that took us more than
10,9,two years to prove.
10,10,So let this be said:
10,11,The gauntlet has
10,12,been thrown down
10,13,but the faculty have answered
10,14,and answered with vigour.
11,0,Hey when's the arraignment?
11,1,Next week.
12,0,Sorry.
12,1,What are you doing?
12,2,Sorry.
12,3,That's people's work.
12,4,You can't graffiti here.
12,5,Don't you walk away from me!
12,6,Hey fuck you!
12,7,Oh you're a clever one.
12,8,What's your name?
13,0,Oh my God.
14,0,Looks right.
15,0,Will how retarded do you gotta
15,1,be to get fired from that job?
15,2,I mean how hard is it to push
15,3,a motherfuckin' broom around?
15,4,Mitch you got fired from
15,5,pushin' a fuckin' broom.
15,6,I got fired 'cause
15,7,management was restructuring.
15,8,Yeah restructuring
15,9,the amount of retards
15,10,they had workin' for 'em.
15,11,Shut up. You get canned
15,12,more than tuna bitch.
15,13,At least I got a motherfuckin'
15,14,job right now don't I?
15,15,Yeah.
15,16,Why'd you get fired Will?
15,17,Come on.
15,18,Management was restructuring.
15,19,My uncle could probably
15,20,get you on a demo team.
15,21,Can he do that?
15,22,You kiddin' me!
15,23,I asked you yesterday
15,24,if I could get a job.
15,25,And I told you 'no' yesterday.
15,26,What's up Casey?
15,27,What's up Case?
15,28,What's up Big Case?
15,29,Let's sit over here.
15,30,All right. Let's go.
15,31,Oh this is...
15,32,this is a Harvard bar huh?
15,33,I thought there'd be like
15,34,equations and shit on the wall.
15,35,I will take a pitcher of the
15,36,finest lager in the house.
16,0,Timeout.
16,1,I'm gonna have to
16,2,bust a little move
16,3,on them Harvard hotties
16,4,down there at the bar.
16,5,Work some magic.
16,6,Get some potion for us.
17,0,Oh hello.
17,1,Oh hello.
17,2,Hi. How are ya?
17,3,Fine.
17,4,So do you ladies uh...
17,5,Come here often?
17,6,Do I come here?
17,7,I come here a bit.
17,8,I'm here you know
17,9,from time to time.
17,10,Do you go to school here?
17,11,Yep.
17,12,Yeah.
17,13,That's it. I think I
17,14,had a class with you.
17,15,Oh yeah. What class?
17,16,History.
17,17,Maybe.
17,18,Yes I think that's what it was.
17,19,You don't necessarily...
17,20,may not remember me. You
17,21,know I like it here.
17,22,It doesn't mean
17,23,'cause I go here
17,24,I'm a genius. I am very smart.
17,25,Hey how's it goin'? How are ya?
17,26,Good. How ya doin'?
17,27,What class did you say that was?
17,28,History.
17,29,Yeah.
17,30,Just history?
17,31,It must have been a
17,32,survey course then.
17,33,Yeah it was. It was surveys.
17,34,Right.
17,35,You should check it out.
17,36,It's a good course.
17,37,It'd be a good class.
17,38,How'd you like that course?
17,39,You know frankly
17,40,I found that class you
17,41,know rather elementary.
17,42,Elementary.
17,43,You know I don't doubt that it was.
17,44,Yeah.
17,45,I uh
17,46,I remember that class.
17,47,It was um...
17,48,it was just between
17,49,recess and lunch.
17,50,Clark why don't you go away?
17,51,Why don't you relax?
17,52,Why don't you go away?
17,53,I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
17,54,That's all.
17,55,Are we gonna have a problem?
17,56,No no no no. There's
17,57,no problem here.
17,58,I was just hoping you
17,59,might give me some insight
17,60,into the evolution of the market
17,61,economy in the southern colonies.
17,62,My contention is that prior
17,63,to the Revolutionary War
17,64,the economic
17,65,modalities especially
17,66,in the southern colonies...
17,67,could most aptly be
17,68,characterized as...
17,69,agrarian pre-capitalist.
17,70,Let me tell you somethin'.
17,71,Of course that's
17,72,your contention.
17,73,You're a first-year
17,74,grad student.
17,75,You just got finished readin'
17,76,some Marxian historian
17,77,Pete Garrison probably...
17,78,You're gonna be convinced
17,79,of that till next month
17,80,when you get to James Lemon.
17,81,Then you're gonna
17,82,be talkin' about
17,83,how the economies of
17,84,Virginia and Pennsylvania...
17,85,were entrepreneurial and
17,86,capitalist way back in 1740.
17,87,That's gonna last
17,88,until next year.
17,89,You're gonna be in here
17,90,regurgitatin' Gordon Wood
17,91,talkin' about you know
17,92,the pre-revolutionary utopia...
17,93,and the capital-forming effects
17,94,of military mobilization.
17,95,Well as a matter
17,96,of fact I won't
17,97,because Wood drastically
17,98,underestimates the impact of...
17,99,Wood drastically underestimates the
17,100,impact of social distinctions...
17,101,predicated upon wealth
17,102,especially inherited wealth.
17,103,You got that from Vickers' Work
17,104,in Essex County. Page 98 right?
17,105,I read that too.
17,106,Were you gonna plagiarize
17,107,the whole thing for us?
17,108,Do you have any thoughts
17,109,of your own on this matter?
17,110,Or is that your thing?
17,111,You come into a bar.
17,112,You read some obscure passage.
17,113,Then pretend... pawn
17,114,it off as your own.
17,115,As your own idea just
17,116,to impress some girls?
17,117,Embarrass my friend?
17,118,See the sad thing about a
17,119,guy like you is in 50 years
17,120,you're gonna start doin'
17,121,some thinkin' on your own.
17,122,You're gonna come
17,123,up with the fact
17,124,that there are two
17,125,certainties in life.
17,126,One: Don't do that.
17,127,And two: You dropped 150 grand
17,128,on a fuckin' education...
17,129,you could've got for $1.50 in late
17,130,charges at the public library.
17,131,Yeah but I will have a degree
17,132,and you'll be
17,133,servin' my kids fries
17,134,at a drive through on
17,135,our way to a skiing trip.
17,136,Maybe
17,137,but at least I
17,138,won't be unoriginal.
17,139,If you have a problem with that
17,140,we could step outside.
17,141,We could figure it out.
17,142,No man there's no problem.
17,143,It's cool.
17,144,It's cool?
17,145,Yeah.
17,146,Cool.
17,147,Damn right it's cool.
17,148,How do you like me now?
17,149,My boy's wicked smart.
17,150,I just spent three minutes
17,151,in this fuckin' place
17,152,and run into a Barney huh?
17,153,There it is.
17,154,Nice to meet you.
17,155,They were fine man.
17,156,I was gonna close
17,157,the deal but then...
17,158,Chuck... Billy uh...
17,159,insulted one of 'em...
17,160,The heavyset girl said I
17,161,had a receding hairline
17,162,and I was a few
17,163,pounds overweight.
17,164,And I was like
17,165,'Go fuck yourself'.
17,166,I swallowed a bug.
17,167,Hi.
17,168,You're an idiot.
17,169,What?
17,170,You're an idiot.
17,171,I've been sitting over
17,172,there for 45 minutes...
17,173,waiting for you to
17,174,come and talk to me.
17,175,But I'm tired now
17,176,and I have to go home.
17,177,And... I couldn't sit there
17,178,anymore waiting for you.
17,179,I'm Will.
17,180,Skylar.
17,181,Skylar.
17,182,Oh and by the way
17,183,that guy over there
17,184,Michael Bolton clone...
17,185,He wasn't sitting
17,186,with us so to speak.
17,187,I know. I kinda got
17,188,that impression.
17,189,Good. Okay.
17,190,Well I've got to go.
17,191,Gotta get up early and
17,192,waste some more money
17,193,on my overpriced education.
17,194,No I didn't mean you.
17,195,That's all right.
17,196,There's my number.
17,197,Maybe we can go out
17,198,for coffee sometime.
17,199,All right yeah.
17,200,Maybe we can just get together
17,201,and eat a bunch of caramels.
17,202,What do you mean?
17,203,When you think about it it's
17,204,as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
17,205,Oh. Yeah. Okay.
17,206,Uh right then.
17,207,Oh come on.
17,208,You're kidding.
17,209,Yo!
17,210,Fuck you bitch!
17,211,Fuck you.
17,212,There goes them fuckin' barneys
17,213,right now with his skiin' trip.
17,214,Hold on.
17,215,We should've beat
17,216,that old bitch's ass.

18,1,Yeah.
18,2,Yeah?
18,3,Well I got her number!
18,4,How do you like them apples?
19,0,Come.

20,2,and Grounds office?
20,3,Yeah. What can I do for you?
20,4,I just need the name of
20,5,a student who works here.
20,6,No students work for me.
20,7,Could you please check?
20,8,I have this guy who
20,9,works in my building.
20,10,He's about this high.
20,11,Which one is your building?
20,12,Two.
20,13,Two. Building two.
21,0,Look if anything was stolen
21,1,I should know about it.
21,2,No no no. It's nothing like that.
21,3,I just need his name.
21,4,I can't give you his name
21,5,unless you've a complaint.

21,10,Please.
21,11,Will didn't show for work today.

21,13,You can call him.
21,14,P.O.?
21,15,Yeah Parole Officer.
21,16,Thank you.
21,17,Ass hole.
21,18,There is a lengthy
21,19,legal precedent
21,20,Your Honour going back to 1789
21,21,whereby a defendant
21,22,can claim self-defence
21,23,against an agent of
21,24,the government...
21,25,if that act is deemed a
21,26,defence against tyranny
21,27,a defence of liberty.

21,29,Henry Ward Beecher
21,30,in Proverbs from Plymouth
21,31,Pulpit 1887 said
21,32,1887 this is the 20th century.
21,33,Excuse me.
21,34,He's gonna make a mockery
21,35,of the court room.
21,36,I am afforded the right to
21,37,speak in my own defence sir
21,38,by the Constitution
21,39,of the United States.
21,40,Don't tell me about the
21,41,Constitution of the United States.
21,42,This guarantees my liberty.
21,43,'Liberty' in case you've forgotten
21,44,is a soul's right to breathe.
21,45,When it cannot take a long
21,46,breath laws are girded too tight.
21,47,Without liberty man is a syncope.
21,48,Man is a what?
21,49,Ibid. Your Honour.
21,50,Son my turn.
21,51,I've been sitting here
21,52,for ten minutes now
21,53,lookin' over this
21,54,rap sheet of yours.
21,55,I just can't believe it.
21,56,June '93 assault.
21,57,September '93 assault.
21,58,Grand theft auto
21,59,February of '94.
21,60,Where apparently
21,61,you defended yourself
21,62,and had the case
21,63,thrown out by citing...
21,64,'free property rights of
21,65,horse and carriage' from 1798.
21,66,Joke. January '95
21,67,impersonating an officer.
21,68,Mayhem theft resisting.
21,69,All overturned.
21,70,I'm also aware that you've been
21,71,through several foster homes.
21,72,The state removed you from three
21,73,because of serious
21,74,physical abuse.
21,75,You know another
21,76,judge might care
21,77,but you hit a cop.
21,78,You're going in.
21,79,Motion to dismiss is denied.
21,80,$50000 bail.
21,81,Thank you.

21,93,who matches that description.
21,94,I think I'd remember.
21,95,Oh all right you got me.
21,96,It's the ugly obnoxious
21,97,toothless loser...
21,98,who got hammered and wouldn't
21,99,leave you alone all night.
21,100,Oh Will! I remember.
21,101,How are you?

21,116,get together sometime this week.
21,117,Sit out at a cafe. Maybe
21,118,have some caramels.
21,119,Oh that sounds wonderful.
21,120,Yeah?
21,121,Yeah sure. Where are you?
21,122,Uh well actually this is just
21,123,a shot in the dark but uh
21,124,there's no chance that
21,125,you're pre-law is there?
21,126,Have a seat.
21,127,Thank you.
21,128,Nice talking to ya.
21,129,What the fuck do you want?
21,130,I'm Gerald Lambeau.
21,131,Professor you told
21,132,to fuck himself.
21,133,Well what the fuck do you want?
21,134,I've spoken to the judge
21,135,and he's agreed to release you
21,136,under my supervision.
21,137,Really?
21,138,Yeah.
22,0,Under two conditions.
22,1,What are those?
22,2,First condition is that you
22,3,meet with me every week.
22,4,What for?
22,5,Go over the proof
22,6,you're working on
22,7,get into some...
22,8,more advanced...
22,9,combinatorial mathematics
22,10,finite math.
22,11,Sounds like a real hoot.
22,12,And the second
22,13,condition is that...
22,14,that you see a therapist.
22,15,I'm responsible to submit
22,16,reports on those meetings.
22,17,If you fail...
22,18,to meet with any of
22,19,those conditions
22,20,you will have to serve time.
22,21,All right. I'll do the math
22,22,but I'm not gonna meet
22,23,with any fuckin' therapist.
22,24,It's better than spending
22,25,that time in jail isn't it?
23,0,I read your book and 'Mike'
23,1,was havin' the same problems...
23,2,that 'Chad'
23,3,the stockbroker was havin'.
23,4,Absolutely right.
23,5,Right on the button.
23,6,Good for you Will. Very nice.
23,7,Thank you.
23,8,Will
23,9,the pressures and
23,10,I'm not judging them.
23,11,I'm not labelling them
23,12,but they are destroying
23,13,your potential.
23,14,No more shenanigans.
23,15,No more tomfoolery.
23,16,No more ballyhoo.
23,17,You're right.
23,18,God I know.
23,19,You're not gonna get off that easily.
23,20,Come on Will
23,21,a bit more.
23,22,Well I mean I do
23,23,do things you know?
23,24,What... what kind of things?
23,25,I do things that you know
23,26,I mean I hide from people.
23,27,You hide do you?
23,28,No no. I mean I like. I go places.
23,29,I interact you know.
23,30,Really? What sort of places?
23,31,Just certain clubs.
23,32,More. That's nice. Yes.
23,33,What sort of clubs?
23,34,Like uh like Fantasy.
23,35,Fantasy. That's
23,36,nice a bit more.
23,37,It's something like
23,38,when you get in there
23,39,the music like owns you.
23,40,It's like that house music.
23,41,It's like...
23,42,You know you start dancin'.
23,43,Boom boom boom. Yeah.
23,44,It's just...
23,45,Yes.
23,46,Do you find it hard to hide
23,47,the fact that you're gay?
23,48,What are you talking about?
23,49,What?
23,50,Look buddy two seconds ago
23,51,you were ready to
23,52,give me a jump.
23,53,A jump?
23,54,Are you...
23,55,I'm terribly sorry
23,56,to disappoint you.
23,57,Hey I don't have
23,58,a problem with it.
23,59,I don't care if you
23,60,putt from the rough.
23,61,What are you...
23,62,putting from the rough?
23,63,What on earth are
23,64,you talking about?
23,65,A difficult theorem
23,66,could be like a symphony.
23,67,It's very erotic.
23,68,You go somewhere else.
23,69,I can't handle this.
23,70,Wow.
23,71,Thank you Henry.
23,72,Ah Henry.
23,73,Hi Gerry.
23,74,You know something?
23,75,I can't do this pro
23,76,bono work anymore.
23,77,It's just not... it's not worth it.
23,78,What happened?
23,79,Well I'm going on national
23,80,television next week.
23,81,I mean I haven't
23,82,got time to tell you
23,83,much less talk to that
23,84,raving looney in there.
23,85,An absolute lunatic he is.
23,86,Henry.
23,87,Okay you are in your bed Will.
23,88,Now
23,89,how old are you?
23,90,Seven.
23,91,What do you see?
23,92,Some things in my room.
23,93,What is it?
23,94,It's like a... it's a figure.
23,95,It's hoverin' over me.
23,96,You are in a safe place Will.
23,97,It's t...
23,98,it's touchin' me.
23,99,Where is it touching you?
23,100,It's touching me down there
23,101,and I'm nervous.
23,102,You don't have to
23,103,be nervous Will.
23,104,We...
23,105,start dancin' and dancin'.
23,106,It's just beautiful
23,107,'cause we...
23,108,can make... a lot of love
23,109,before the sun goes down.
24,0,I'm sorry Rich.
24,1,I have better things to do with my time.
24,2,Hey. Afternoon delight.
24,3,Come on! One dance!
24,4,You really hypnotized
24,5,me you know?
24,6,For God's sake Will.
24,7,What? Oh come on.
24,8,He left. You can't
24,9,pin that on me.
24,10,I told you to cooperate
24,11,with these people.
24,12,Look... into my eyes.
24,13,Get out Will.
24,14,I don't need therapy.
24,15,That's enough. Get out!
24,16,I called Mel Weintraub
24,17,this morning to see...
24,18,Oh what's the use?
24,19,What do you want to do?
25,0,Well there's someone.
25,1,Who is he?
25,2,He used to be my uh...
25,3,my room-mate in college.
25,4,Trust.
25,5,Very important...
25,6,in a relationship. It's also very
25,7,important in a clinical situation.
25,8,Why is trust the most
25,9,important thing...
25,10,in making a breakthrough
25,11,with a client?
25,12,Maureen stop the oral fixation
25,13,for a moment and join us.
25,14,Vinnie.
25,15,Um...
25,16,Because uh...
25,17,Trust is uh...
25,18,trust is life.
25,19,Wow.
25,20,That's very deep.
25,21,Thank you Vinnie.
25,22,Next time get the
25,23,notes from your brother.
25,24,If a patient doesn't feel
25,25,safe enough trust you
25,26,then they won't be
25,27,honest with you.
25,28,Then there's really no point
25,29,for them being in therapy.
25,30,I mean hey if they
25,31,don't trust you
25,32,you're never gonna get
25,33,them to sleep with you.
25,34,That should be the goal
25,35,of any good therapist.
25,36,Nail 'em while
25,37,they're vulnerable.
25,38,That's my motto.
25,39,Oh good everyone's back.
25,40,Welcome back everybody.
25,41,Hello Sean.
25,42,Hey Gerry.
25,43,Um
25,44,ladies and gentlemen
25,45,we are in the
25,46,presence of greatness.
25,47,Professor Gerald Lambeau
25,48,Field's medal winner for
25,49,combinatorial mathematics.
25,50,Hello.
25,51,Anyone know what the
25,52,Field's medal is?
25,53,It's a really big deal.
25,54,It's like the Nobel
25,55,prize for math.
25,56,Except they only give it
25,57,out once every four years.
25,58,It's a great thing.
25,59,It's an amazing honour.
25,60,Okay everybody
25,61,that's it for today.
25,62,Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
25,63,We'll be talking about Freud.
25,64,Why he did enough cocaine
25,65,to kill a small horse.
25,66,Thank you.
25,67,How are you?
25,68,It's good to see you.
25,69,Good to see you.
25,70,Sean?
25,71,Yeah?
25,72,I think I got something
25,73,interesting for ya.
25,74,What you have to have blood in urine?
25,75,What's up?
25,76,Why didn't you come
25,77,to the reunion?
25,78,You know I'm...
25,79,I've been busy.
25,80,You were missed.
25,81,Really?
25,82,So how long has it been
25,83,since we've seen each other?
25,84,Before Nancy died.
25,85,Yeah I'm sorry.
25,86,I was in Paris.
25,87,It was that damn conference.
25,88,I got your card. It was nice.
26,0,Come here.
26,1,Now that's a take-down.
26,2,Hey what happened?
26,3,Did you get leniency or what?
26,4,I got uh
26,5,probation and then
26,6,counselling two days a week.
26,7,Joke.
26,8,You're a smoothie. Come on Morgan!
26,9,Just submit!
26,10,Hey Bill just...
26,11,just get off him. We're
26,12,gonna miss the game.
26,13,I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
26,14,Sean Sean.
26,15,This...this boy is incredible.
26,16,I've never seen
26,17,anything like him.
26,18,What makes him so
26,19,incredible Gerry?
26,20,You ever heard of Ramanujan?
26,21,Yeah yeah.
26,22,No.
26,23,It's a man.
26,24,He lived over 100 years ago.
26,25,He was Indian.
26,26,Dots not feathers.
26,27,Not feathers. Yeah.
26,28,He lived in this tiny
26,29,hut somewhere in India.
26,30,He had no formal education.
26,31,He had no access to any scientific work.
26,32,Coffee?
26,33,You sir?
26,34,Just a little.
26,35,But he came across
26,36,this old math book
26,37,and from the simple text
26,38,he was able to
26,39,extrapolate theories...
26,40,that had baffled
26,41,mathematicians for years.
26,42,Yes. Continued fractions.
26,43,He wrote uh...
26,44,Well he mailed it to
26,45,Hardy at Cambridge.
26,46,Yeah Cambridge yeah.
26,47,And Hardy immediately recognized
26,48,the brilliance of his work...
26,49,And brought him over to England
26,50,and then they worked
26,51,together for years
26,52,creating some of the most
26,53,exciting math theory ever done.
26,54,This... this Ramanujan...
26,55,his... his genius was
26,56,unparalleled Sean.
26,57,Well this boy's just like that.
26,58,But he's... he's
26,59,a bit defensive.
26,60,I need someone who can
26,61,get through to him.
26,62,Like me?
26,63,Yeah like you.
26,64,Why?
26,65,Well because you have the
26,66,same kind of background.
26,67,What background?
26,68,Well you're from the
26,69,same neighbourhood.
26,70,He's from Southie?
26,71,Yeah.
26,72,Boy genius from Southie.
26,73,How many shrinks
26,74,you go to before me?
26,75,Five.
26,76,Let me guess. Barry?
26,77,Yeah.
26,78,Henry?
26,79,Yeah.
26,80,Not Rick?
26,81,Sean please...
26,82, just meet with
26,83,him once a week.
26,84,Please?
26,85,It's a poker game with this kid.
26,86,Don't let him know
26,87,what you've got.
26,88,He probably even read your book
26,89,if he could find it.
26,90,It's gonna be hard
26,91,for him to find.
26,92,Hi Will.
26,93,Hi.
26,94,This is Sean Maguire.
26,95,Will Hunting.
26,96,How are ya?
27,0,Yeah. Let's get started.
27,1,Yeah let's do it. I'm pumped.
27,2,Let's let the healing begin.
27,3,Will you excuse us?
27,4,Yeah please Tom.
27,5,You too Gerry.
27,6,Yeah of course.
28,0,How are you?
28,1,Where you from in Southie?
28,2,I like what you've
28,3,done with the place.
28,4,Oh thanks.
28,5,Do you buy all
28,6,these books retail
28,7,or do you send away for
28,8,like a 'shrink kit'
28,9,that comes with all
28,10,these volumes included?
28,11,Do you like books?
28,12,Yeah.
28,13,Did you read any of these books?
28,14,I don't know.
28,15,How about any of these books?
28,16,Probably not.
28,17,What about the ones on the top shelf?
28,18,You read those?
28,19,Yeah I read those.
28,20,Good for you.
28,21,What do you think about 'em?
28,22,I'm not here for a
28,23,fuckin' book report.
28,24,They're your books.
28,25,Why don't you read 'em?
28,26,I did. I had to.
28,27,Must've taken you a long time.
28,28,Yeah it did.
29,0,United States of America:
29,1,A Complete History
29,2,Volume I.
30,0,Jesus.
30,1,If you wanna read a
30,2,real history book
30,3,read Howard Zinn's A People's
30,4,History in the United States.
30,5,That book'll fuckin'
30,6,knock you on your ass.
30,7,Better than Chomsky's
30,8,Manufacturing Consent?
30,9,Do you think that's a good book?
30,10,You fuckin' people baffle me.
30,11,You spend all your money on
30,12,these fuckin' fancy books.
30,13,You surround
30,14,yourselves with 'em.
30,15,They're the wrong fuckin' books.
30,16,What are the right
30,17,fuckin' books Will?
30,18,Whatever blows your hair back.
30,19,Yeah. Haven't got
30,20,much hair left.
30,21,Hey you know you'd be
30,22,better shoving that cigarette
30,23,up your ass. It'd probably
30,24,be healthier for you.
30,25,Yeah I know. It really
30,26,gets in the way of my yoga.
30,27,You work out huh?
30,28,What you lift?
30,29,Yeah.
30,30,Nautilus?
30,31,No free weights.
30,32,Oh really? Free weights huh?
30,33,Yeah. Yeah big time.
30,34,Yeah?
30,35,Just like that.
30,36,What do you bench?
30,37,285. What do you bench?
30,38,You paint that?
30,39,Yeah.
30,40,Do you paint?
30,41,Do you sculpt?
30,42,No.
30,43,Do you like art?
30,44,Do you like music?
30,45,This is a real piece of shit.
30,46,Oh tell me what
30,47,you really think.
30,48,I don't know. Just the...
30,49,linear and impressionistic mix
30,50,makes a very
30,51,muddled composition.
30,52,It's also a Winslow
30,53,Homer rip-off
30,54,except you got whitey
30,55,rowin' the boat there.
30,56,Well it's art Monet.
30,57,It wasn't very good.
30,58,That's not really what
30,59,concerns me though.
30,60,What concerns you?
30,61,Just the colouring.
30,62,You know what the real bitch of it is?
30,63,It's paint-by-number.
30,64,Is it colour-by-number?
30,65,Because the colours
30,66,are fascinating to me.
30,67,Aren't they really?
30,68,You bet.
30,69,I think you're
30,70,about one step away
30,71,from cuttin' your
30,72,fuckin' ear off.
30,73,Really?
30,74,Oh yeah.
30,75,Think I should move to
30,76,the south of France
30,77,change my name to 'Vincent'?
30,78,You ever heard the sayin'
30,79,'any port in a storm'?
30,80,Yeah.
30,81,Yeah maybe that means you.
30,82,In what way?
30,83,Maybe you're in the middle of
30,84,a storm a big fuckin' storm.
30,85,Yeah maybe.
30,86,The sky's fallin' on your head.
30,87,The waves are crashin'
30,88,over your little boat.
30,89,The oars are about to snap.
30,90,You just piss in your pants.
30,91,You're cryin' for the harbour.
30,92,So maybe you do what
30,93,you gotta do to get out.
30,94,You know maybe you
30,95,became a psychologist.
30,96,Bingo. That's it.
30,97,Let me do my job now. You
30,98,start with me. Come on.
30,99,Maybe you married
30,100,the wrong woman.
30,101,Maybe you should
30,102,watch your mouth!
30,103,Watch it right there
30,104,chief all right?
30,105,Ah.
31,0,That's it isn't it?
31,1,You married the wrong woman.
31,2,What happened?
31,3,What did she leave you?
31,4,Was she you know...
31,5,banging some other guy?
31,6,If you ever disrespect my
31,7,wife again I will end you.
31,8,I will fuckin' end you.
31,9,Got that chief?
31,10,Time's up.
31,11,Yeah.
32,0,At ease gentlemen.
33,0,You okay?
34,0,Look I'll understand if you
34,1,don't wanna meet with him again.
34,2,Thursday 4:00. Make
34,3,sure the kid's here.
34,4,Yeah.
34,5,Thanks.
35,0,Well you look lovely
35,1,in those glasses.
35,2,Thank you very much.
35,3,They're just beautiful.
35,4,Yes I always wanted
35,5,dark blue eye shadow.
35,6,Wonderful.
35,7,Growing up in England you know
35,8,I went to a very nice school.
35,9,You know it was kind of...
35,10,progressive organic
35,11,do-it-yourself private school.
35,12,Then Harvard.
35,13,Hopefully med school.
35,14,You know I figured
35,15,out by the end
35,16,my brain's gonna
35,17,be worth $250000.
35,18,That sounded
35,19,horrible didn't it?
35,20,Bring me another mai tai!
35,21,Yeah that's cool.
35,22,I mean I bet your
35,23,parents were happy to pay.
35,24,No I was happy to pay.
35,25,I inherited the money.
35,26,Wow.
35,27,Is Harvard gettin'
35,28,all that money?
35,29,No Stanford. I'm going there
35,30,in June when I graduate.
35,31,All right so you
35,32,just wanted to use
35,33,this sailor and
35,34,then run away huh?
35,35,Well I was gonna you know
35,36,experiment on you for anatomy
35,37,class first obviously.
35,38,In that case that's fine.
35,39,Hey you wanna see my
35,40,magic tricks Skylar?
35,41,Of course.
35,42,All right.
35,43,Promise to...
35,44,All right.
35,45,This one's for you Rudolph.
35,46,Wait wait. You need my wand.
35,47,All right give me a hit.
35,48,Thank you. All right.
35,49,I'm gonna make all these
35,50,caramels disappear.
35,51,You ready?
35,52,Ready.
35,53,One
35,54,two
35,55,three.
35,56,They're all gone.
35,57,That was my... It works
35,58,better when I have my rabbit.
35,59,Well...
35,60,I don't really date
35,61,you know that much.
35,62,How very unfortunate...
35,63,I think for me.
35,64,You know what I mean?
35,65,I know you've been
35,66,thinking about it.
35,67,Oh no I haven't.
35,68,Yes you have.
35,69,No I really haven't.
35,70,Yes you have. You're hoping
35,71,to get good night kiss.
35,72,No you know I tell ya
35,73,I was hopin' to get
35,74,a good night laid.
35,75,But I'll settle for
35,76,like a kiss you know?
35,77,How very noble of you.
35,78,Thank you.
35,79,No I was... I was
35,80,hopin' for a kiss.
35,81,Well why don't we just
35,82,get it out of the way now?
35,83,Right now?
35,84,Yeah.
35,85,Come on.
36,0,I think I got some
36,1,of your pickle.
37,0,You again huh?
37,1,Come with me.
38,0,So what's this?
38,1,A Taster's Choice
38,2,moment between guys?
38,3,This is really nice.
38,4,You got a thing for swans?
38,5,Is this like a fetish?
38,6,Is it something like
38,7,maybe we need to
38,8,devote some time to?
38,9,Thought about what you
38,10,said to me the other day.
38,11,About my painting.
38,12,Stayed up half the
38,13,night thinking about it.
38,14,Something occurred to me.
38,15,I fell into a deep
38,16,peaceful sleep
38,17,and haven't thought
38,18,about you since.
38,19,You know what occurred to me?
38,20,No.
38,21,You're just a kid.
38,22,You don't have the faintest
38,23,idea what you're talking about.
38,24,Why thank you.
38,25,It's all right.
38,26,You've never been out of Boston.
38,27,Nope.
38,28,So if I asked you about art
38,29,you'd probably
38,30,give me the skinny
38,31,on every art book ever written.
38,32,Michelangelo?
38,33,You know a lot about him.
38,34,Life's work
38,35,political aspirations.
38,36,Him and the pope.
38,37,Sexual orientation.
38,38,The whole works right?
38,39,I bet you can't tell me
38,40,what it smells like
38,41,in the Sistine Chapel.
38,42,You never actually stood there
38,43,and looked up at that
38,44,beautiful ceiling.
38,45,Seeing that.
38,46,If I ask you about women
38,47,you'll probably give me a syllabus
38,48,of your personal favourites.
38,49,You may have even
38,50,been laid a few times.
39,0,But you can't tell
39,1,me what it feels like
39,2,to wake up next to a woman
39,3,and feel truly happy.
39,4,You're a tough kid.
39,5,I ask you about
39,6,war you'd probably
39,7,throw Shakespeare at me right?
39,8,'Once more into the
39,9,breach dear friends.'
39,10,But you've never been near one.
39,11,You've never held your best
39,12,friend's head in your lap...
39,13,and watch him gasp his last
39,14,breath lookin' to you for help.
39,15,If I asked you about love
39,16,you'd probably
39,17,quote me a sonnet
39,18,but you've never
39,19,looked at a woman
39,20,and been totally vulnerable.
39,21,Known someone that could
39,22,level you with her eyes.
39,23,Feelin' like God put an
39,24,angel on earth just for you
39,25,who could rescue you
39,26,from the depths of hell.
39,27,And you wouldn't know what
39,28,it's like to be her angel
39,29,to have that love for
39,30,her be there forever.
39,31,Through anything.
39,32,Through cancer.
39,33,And you wouldn't
39,34,know about sleepin'
39,35,sittin' up in a hospital room...
39,36,for two months
39,37,holding her hand
39,38,because the doctors
39,39,could see in your eyes...
39,40,that the terms 'visiting
39,41,hours' don't apply to you.
39,42,You don't know about real loss
39,43,'cause that only
39,44,occurs when you love
39,45,something more than
39,46,you love yourself.
39,47,I doubt you've ever dared
39,48,to love anybody that much.
39,49,I look at you.
39,50,I don't see an
39,51,intelligent confident man.
39,52,I see a cocky
39,53,scared shitless kid.
39,54,But you're a genius Will.
39,55,No one denies that.
39,56,No one could possibly
39,57,understand the depths of you.
39,58,But you presume
39,59,to know everything
39,60,about me because you
39,61,saw a painting of mine.
39,62,You ripped my
39,63,fuckin' life apart.
39,64,You're an orphan right?
40,0,Do you think I'd
40,1,know the first thing
40,2,about how hard your
40,3,life has been...
40,4,how you feel who you are...
40,5,because I read Oliver Twist?
40,6,Does that encapsulate you?
40,7,Personally
40,8,I don't give a shit about all
40,9,that because... you know what?
40,10,I can't learn
40,11,anything from you...
40,12,I can't read in
40,13,some fuckin' book.
40,14,Unless you wanna talk about you
40,15,who you are.
40,16,And I'm fascinated.
40,17,I'm in.
40,18,But you don't wanna do
40,19,that do you sport?
40,20,You're terrified of
40,21,what you might say.
41,0,Your move chief.
42,0,Hello?
42,1,Hello?
42,2,Hello?
42,3,Professor Valenti are
42,4,you calling me again?
42,5,Freak.
42,6,Oh God.
42,7,Christ who did you call?
42,8,No one. I forgot the number.
42,9,You fuckin' retarded?
42,10,You went all the way
42,11,out there in the rain
42,12,and you didn't bring the number.
42,13,No it was your
42,14,mother's 900 number.
42,15,I just ran out of quarters.
42,16,Why don't we get off on mothers?
42,17,I just got off yours.
42,18,That's pretty funny Morgan.
42,19,That's a fuckin' nickel bitch.
42,20,Keep antagonizing me.
42,21,Watch what happens.
42,22,All right then Morgan.
42,23,Watch what happens.
42,24,All right then Morgan.
42,25,Watch what happens.
42,26,Keep fuckin' with me.
43,0,No smoking.
44,0,What do you mean
44,1,he didn't talk?
44,2,You were in there for an hour.
44,3,He just sat there
44,4,counting the seconds
44,5,until the session was over.
44,6,Pretty impressive actually.
44,7,Why would he do that?
44,8,To prove to me he doesn't
44,9,have to talk to me
44,10,if he doesn't want to.
44,11,What is this? Some
44,12,kind of staring contest
44,13,between two kids from
44,14,the old neighbourhood?
44,15,Yeah it is
44,16,and I can't talk first.
44,17,We know your theory Alexander
44,18,but the boy's found a
44,19,simple geometrical picture.
44,20,A tree structure won't work.
44,21,Look now. He's joining
44,22,the two vertices.
44,23,But I can do the sum.
44,24,It's how you group
44,25,the terms Alexander.
44,26,But Gerry if we do the
44,27,whole thing this way then...
44,28,Hey look look.
44,29,I wrote it down.
44,30,It's simpler this way.
45,0,Sometimes people get lucky.
45,1,You're a brilliant man.
46,0,You know I was on
46,1,this plane once
46,2,and I'm sittin' there and...
46,3,the captain gets on he
46,4,does his whole you know
46,5,'we'll be cruisin'
46,6,at 35000 feet'
46,7,but then he puts the mike down.
46,8,He forgets to turn it off.
46,9,So he turns to the copilot.
46,10,He's like 'You know
46,11,all I could use right
46,12,now is a fuckin'
46,13,blow job and a cup of coffee.'
46,14,So the stewardess
46,15,fuckin' goes bombin'
46,16,up from the back of the plane...
46,17,to tell him the
46,18,microphone's still on.
46,19,This guy in the back
46,20,of the plane's like
46,21,'Hey hon don't
46,22,forget the coffee'.
46,23,You ever been on a plane?
46,24,No but it's a fuckin' joke.
46,25,It works better if I tell
46,26,it in the first person.
46,27,Yeah it does.
46,28,I have been laid you know?
46,29,Really?
46,30,Good for you.
46,31,Big time.
46,32,Big time huh?
46,33,I went on a date last week.
46,34,How'd it go?
46,35,It was good.
46,36,Goin' out again?
46,37,I don't know.
46,38,Why not?
46,39,Haven't called her.
46,40,Christ you're an amateur.
46,41,I know what I'm doin'.
46,42,Oh yeah?
46,43,Don't worry about me.
46,44,I know what I'm doin'.
46,45,Yeah but this girl was
46,46,like you know beautiful.
46,47,She's smart. She's fun.
46,48,She's different from most
46,49,of the girls I've been with.
46,50,So call her up Romeo.
46,51,Why so I can realize
46,52,she's not that smart.
46,53,That she's fuckin' boring?
46,54,You know I mean you don't...
46,55,This girl's like
46,56,fuckin' perfect right now.
46,57,I don't wanna ruin that.
46,58,Maybe you're perfect right now.
46,59,Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.
46,60,But I think that's a
46,61,super philosophy Will.
46,62,That way you can go
46,63,through your entire life
46,64,without ever having to
46,65,really know anybody.
46,66,My wife used to fart
46,67,when she was nervous.
46,68,She had all sorts of
46,69,wonderful idiosyncrasies.
46,70,You know she used
46,71,to fart in her sleep.
46,72,Just thought I'd
46,73,share that with you.
46,74,One night it was so
46,75,loud it woke the dog up.
46,76,She woke up and gone
46,77,like 'Was that you?'
46,78,I said 'Yeah'. I didn't
46,79,have the heart to tell her.
46,80,Oh God.
46,81,She woke herself up?
46,82,Yes.
47,0,Oh Christ.
47,1,But Will she's
47,2,been dead two years
47,3,and that's the shit I remember.
47,4,It's wonderful stuff you know?
47,5,Little things like that.
47,6,Yeah but those are the
47,7,things I miss the most.
47,8,Those little idiosyncrasies
47,9,that only I knew about.
47,10,That's what made her my wife.
47,11,Boy and she had
47,12,the goods on me too.
47,13,She knew all my
47,14,little peccadilloes.
47,15,People call these
47,16,things 'imperfections'
47,17,but they're not.
47,18,That's the good stuff.
47,19,And then we get to choose
47,20,who we let into our
47,21,weird little worlds.
47,22,You're not perfect sport.
47,23,And let me save
47,24,you the suspense.
47,25,This girl you met
47,26,she isn't perfect either.
47,27,But the question
47,28,is whether or not
47,29,you're perfect for each other.
47,30,That's the whole deal.
47,31,That's what intimacy
47,32,is all about.
47,33,Now you can know everything
47,34,in the world sport
47,35,but the only way you're
47,36,findin' out that one
47,37,is by givin' it a shot.
47,38,You certainly won't learn
47,39,from an old fucker like me.
47,40,Even if I did know I wouldn't
47,41,tell a pissant like you.
47,42,Yeah why not?
47,43,You told me every other fuckin' thing.
47,44,Jesus Christ.
47,45,Fuckin' talk more than any
47,46,shrink I ever seen in my life.
47,47,I teach the shit. I didn't
47,48,say I knew how to do it.
47,49,Yeah.
48,0,You ever think about
48,1,gettin' remarried?
48,2,My wife's dead.
48,3,Hence the word 'remarried'.
48,4,She's dead.
48,5,Yeah well I think that's
48,6,a super philosophy Sean.
48,7,I mean that way
48,8,you can actually
48,9,go through the rest
48,10,of your life...
48,11,without ever really
48,12,knowing anybody.
48,13,Time's up.
49,0,Hold it open.
49,1,Okay.
49,2,Thanks.
50,0,'G' minor seventh
50,1,saddest of all chords.
50,2,Hello.
50,3,Hey.
50,4,Where have you been?
50,5,I'm sorry. I've been
50,6,like... really busy and...
50,7,But um...
50,8,Me too.
50,9,Yeah.
50,10,I...
50,11,I thought you'd call.
50,12,Yeah um...
50,13,I mean we had a
50,14,really good time.
50,15,I had a really good time too.
50,16,I mean I just... I...
50,17,I'm sorry you know. I blew it.
50,18,No. No I mean you
50,19,know it's all right.
50,20,Yeah um so I was...
50,21,wonderin' if uh
50,22,if you know you'd give
50,23,me another crack at it.
50,24,You know let me
50,25,take you out again.
50,26,I can't.
50,27,All right.
50,28,Oh no I didn't...
50,29,I didn't mean I
50,30,can't like ever.
50,31,I just can't right now.
50,32,I've got to assign the proton
50,33,spectrum for 'ebogamine'.
50,34,All that sounds really
50,35,really interesting.
50,36,It's actually
50,37,fantastically boring.
50,38,All right um...
50,39,Maybe some other time.
50,40,Like tomorrow?
50,41,Um yeah all right.
50,42,Okay.
50,43,Okay.
50,44,Bye.
50,45,Bye.
51,0,What are you doing here?
51,1,I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
51,2,Where the fuck did you get this?
51,3,I had to sleep with
51,4,someone in your class.
51,5,Oh I hope it was someone
51,6,with the open-toed sandals
51,7,and the really bad breath.
51,8,Come on. Let's go have some fun.
51,9,No I've got to learn this.
51,10,Well you're not going into
51,11,surgery tomorrow are you?
51,12,No.
51,13,Let's go.
51,14,Oh my God! My dog is winning!
51,15,Come on Misty!
51,16,Come on! Run! Look at that!
51,17,Come on!
51,18,Look there he goes. Misty run!
51,19,Come on!
51,20,We won.
51,21,He totally won.
51,22,So did you grow up
51,23,around here then?
51,24,Not far. South Boston.
51,25,Still glowing from my win.
51,26,Look at you. You're so happy.
51,27,And what was that like then?
51,28,It was normal I guess.
51,29,Nothin' special.
51,30,Do you got lots of
51,31,brothers and sisters?
51,32,Do I have a lot of
51,33,brothers and sisters?
51,34,That's what I said.
51,35,Well Irish Catholic
51,36,what do you think?
51,37,Right. That's right.
51,38,How many?
51,39,God. You wouldn't
51,40,believe me if I told you.
51,41,Why? Go on. What? Five?
51,42,No.
51,43,Seven?
51,44,Eight? How many?
51,45,I have 12 big brothers.

51,89,What? Wonder if I'd be
51,90,better off without her?
51,91,No no no I'm not
51,92,saying like better off.
51,93,No.
51,94,I didn't mean it like that.
51,95,It's all right. It's
51,96,an important question.
51,97,'Cause you'll have bad times
51,98,but that'll always
51,99,wake you up...
51,100,to the good stuff you
51,101,weren't paying attention to.
51,102,And you don't regret
51,103,meetin' your wife?
51,104,Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?
51,105,Oh I got regrets Will but
51,106,I don't regret a single
51,107,day I spent with her.
52,0,So when did you know like
52,1,that she was the one for you?
52,2,October 21 1975.
52,3,Jesus Christ. You
52,4,know the fuckin' day?
52,5,Oh yeah
52,6,'cause it was game six
52,7,of the World Series
52,8,biggest game in Red Sox history.
52,9,Yeah sure.
52,10,My friends and I had slept
52,11,out all night to get tickets.
52,12,You got tickets?
52,13,Yep. Day of the game
52,14,I was sittin' in a bar
52,15,waitin' for the game to start
52,16,and in walks this girl.
52,17,It was an amazing game though.
52,18,You know bottom of the
52,19,eighth Carbo ties it up.
52,20,It was 6-6.
52,21,It went to 12.
52,22,Bottom of the 12th
52,23,in stepped Carlton
52,24,Fisk old Pudge.
52,25,Steps up to the plate. You know
52,26,he's got that weird stance.
52,27,Yeah yeah.
52,28,And then 'Boom'! He
52,29,clocks it you know.
52,30,High fly ball down
52,31,the left field line!
52,32,Thirty-five thousand
52,33,people on their feet
52,34,yellin' at the ball.
52,35,But that's nothin'
52,36,'cause Fisk he's wavin'
52,37,at the ball like a madman.
52,38,Yeah I've seen that.
52,39,'Get over! Get over!
52,40,Right.
52,41,Get over!'
52,42,Then it hits the foul pole.
52,43,He goes ape-shit
52,44,and 35000 fans...
52,45,They charge the field you know.
52,46,Yeah and he's fuckin'
52,47,blowin' people outta the way.
52,48,'Get outta the way!
52,49,Get outta the way!'
52,50,I can't fuckin' believe you had
52,51,tickets to that fuckin' game!
52,52,Did you rush the field?
52,53,No I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
52,54,I wasn't there.
52,55,What?
52,56,No I was in a bar havin'
52,57,a drink with my future wife.
52,58,You missed Pudge Fisk's home run...
52,59,Oh yeah.
52,60,to have a fuckin' drink with
52,61,some lady you never met?
52,62,Yeah but you should have seen her.
52,63,She was a stunner.
52,64,I don't care if...
52,65,Oh no no she lit up the room.
52,66,I don't care if Helen of
52,67,Troy walks into the room.
52,68,Oh Helen of Troy!
52,69,That's game six! Oh my God
52,70,and who were these
52,71,friends of yours?
52,72,They let you get away with that?
52,73,They had to.
52,74,What did you say to 'em?
52,75,I just slid my ticket
52,76,across the table.
52,77,I said 'Sorry guys.
52,78,I gotta see about a girl.'
52,79,'I gotta go see about a girl'?
52,80,Yes!
52,81,That's what you said? They
52,82,let you get away with that?
52,83,Oh yeah. They saw it in
52,84,my eyes that I meant it.
52,85,You're kiddin' me?
52,86,No I'm not kidding you Will.
52,87,That's why I'm not
52,88,talkin' right now
52,89,about some girl I saw
52,90,at a bar 20 years ago...
52,91,and how I always regretted not
52,92,goin' over and talkin' to her.
52,93,I don't regret the 18 years
52,94,I was married to Nancy.
52,95,I don't regret the six years
52,96,I had to give up counselling
52,97,when she got sick
52,98,and I don't regret the last
52,99,years when she got really sick.
52,100,And I sure as hell don't
52,101,regret missin' a damn game.
52,102,That's regret.
52,103,Wow!
53,0,Would have been nice to
53,1,catch that game though.
53,2,I didn't know Pudge was
53,3,gonna hit a home run.
53,4,You know
53,5,I'm very very useful on the court.
53,6,I'm extremely tall.
53,7,You're not that tall.
53,8,I dunk.
53,9,Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?
53,10,'It is decidedly so.'
53,11,Why do we always stay here?
53,12,'Cause it's nicer than my place.
53,13,Yes but I've never
53,14,seen your place.
53,15,I know.
53,16,When am I gonna meet your
53,17,friends and your brothers?
53,18,Well they don't really
53,19,come down here that much.
53,20,I think I can make
53,21,it to South Boston.
53,22,It's kind of a hike.
53,23,Is it me you're hiding from
53,24,them or the other way around?
53,25,All right we'll go.
53,26,When?
53,27,I don't know. We'll
53,28,go sometime next week.
53,29,What if I said I would
53,30,not sleep with you again
53,31,until you let me
53,32,meet your friends?
54,0,I'd say it's like
54,1,4:30 in the mornin'.
54,2,They're probably up.
54,3,Oh my God.
54,4,Men are shameless.
54,5,If you're not thinking
54,6,with your wiener
54,7,then you're acting
54,8,directly on its behalf.
54,9,You bet. And on
54,10,behalf of my wiener
54,11,can I get an advance payment?
54,12,I don't know. Let's ask.
54,13,'Outlook does not look good.'
54,14,What?
54,15,Fuck the... Hey Chuck. No.
54,16,Nothing. Go back to sleep.
54,17,'Outlook'? That's the same thing
54,18,that told you you was
54,19,gonna play in the N.B.A.
54,20,Well exactly so look out.
54,21,You'd better start buying
54,22,some season tickets.
54,23,I plan to. I'm tall.
54,24,I like wearing shorts.
54,25,Hook hook. Dunk dunk.
54,26,You're not that tall.
54,27,Yes I am.
54,28,Maybe I'm all
54,29,about three points.
54,30,I'm all about home runs.
54,31,Stop mixing your
54,32,sporting metaphors.
55,0,A leprechaun's got his
55,1,dick in the monkey's ass.
55,2,Morgan comes runnin' in goin'
55,3,'I don't mind it. I don't mind.'
55,4,Well I can't believe
55,5,you brought Skylar here
55,6,when we're fuckin' all
55,7,bombed and drinkin'.
55,8,I know Morgan. It's a real
55,9,rarity we'd be all drinkin'.
55,10,My uncle Marty drinks.
55,11,He'll go on a bender
55,12,for six eight months.
55,13,Did I ever tell ya
55,14,what happened to him
55,15,when he was drivin' up
55,16,there and got pulled over?
55,17,I told you guys right?
55,18,Marty yeah.
55,19,Let me tell ya what
55,20,happened to my uncle Marty
55,21,because you oughta know this.
55,22,He's always tellin' stories.
55,23,Every time we come here
55,24,he's got another story.
55,25,But we all heard this one.
55,26,Go ahead. Say it anyway.
55,27,I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
55,28,Guess I have the floor now.
55,29,My uncle Marty's
55,30,drivin' home right?
55,31,Bombed out of his tree right?
55,32,Just hammered out of his gourd.
55,33,Just wrecked.
55,34,This state trooper sees
55,35,him pulls him over.
55,36,So my uncle's fucked basically.
55,37,Got him out of the car tryin'
55,38,to make him walk the line.
55,39,He gets out of the car
55,40,pukes and the statie's pretty
55,41,sure he's over the legal limit.
55,42,So he's about to throw the cuffs
55,43,on him and put him in jail.
55,44,All of a sudden 50
55,45,yards down the road
55,46,there's this huge
55,47,fuckin' boom right?
55,48,Statie gets real spooked.
55,49,He turns around.
55,50,He got shot?
55,51,No. So... So... You
55,52,heard this story before.
55,53,Yeah Morgan stop. Stop.
55,54,Some other guy's
55,55,car had hit a tree.
55,56,Okay. There was an accident.
55,57,Anyway...
55,58,How could he hear...
55,59,Shut the fuck up!
55,60,You're drivin' him nuts Morgan.
55,61,I'm gonna break your neck.
55,62,Shut up!
55,63,He told you the
55,64,story once before.
55,65,So he tells my uncle 'Stay here.
55,66,Don't move.'
55,67,Statie goes runnin' down the
55,68,road to deal with
55,69,the other accident.
55,70,After a few minutes of just
55,71,lyin' in his own piss and vomit
55,72,my uncle starts wonderin'
55,73,what he's doin' there.
55,74,Gets up gets in his car
55,75,and just drives home.
55,76,The next mornin' my
55,77,uncle's just passed out.
55,78,He hears this
55,79,knockin' at the door.
55,80,So he goes downstairs
55,81,pulls the door open 'What?'
55,82,It's the state trooper
55,83,that pulled him over.
55,84,Statie says 'Fuck
55,85,you mean 'What?'
55,86,You know what.
55,87,I pulled you over last night
55,88,is what and you took off.'
55,89,He's like 'I never seen
55,90,you before in my life.
55,91,I've been home all
55,92,night with my kids.
55,93,I don't know who
55,94,the fuck you are.'
55,95,He's like 'You know who I am.
55,96,Let me get in your garage.'
55,97,My uncle's like
55,98,'What?' He said 'You heard me.
55,99,Let me get in your garage.'
55,100,He was like 'All right. Fine.'
55,101,Takes him out to the
55,102,garage opens the door.
55,103,And there's...
55,104,the statie's police cruiser
55,105,is in my uncle's garage.
55,106,He was so fuckin'...
55,107,He was so fuckin' hammered
55,108,he drove the wrong car home.
55,109,The best part about it is
55,110,the fuckin' state trooper...
55,111,was so embarrassed he
55,112,didn't do anything.
55,113,He'd been drivin' around all
55,114,night in my uncle's Chevelle
55,115,lookin' for the house.
55,116,All right Chuck what the fuck
55,117,is the point of your story?
55,118,He got away. That's the point.
55,119,Well question...
55,120,Come on. Stop.
55,121,I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
55,122,You're embarrassing him.
55,123,It doesn't make any sense.
55,124,It does make sense
55,125,if you listen to the story
55,126,and quit askin' questions.
55,127,Well let's see if
55,128,you can get this one.
55,129,I've got a little story for you.
55,130,All right.
55,131,There's an old couple in bed
55,132,Mary and Paddie.
55,133,They wake up on the
55,134,morning of their
55,135,50th anniversary.
55,136,Mary looks over and gazes
55,137,adoringly at Paddie.
55,138,She's like 'Oh Jesus Paddie.
55,139,You're such a good-looking feller.
55,140,I love ya.
55,141,I want to give ya
55,142,a little present.
55,143,Anything your little heart desires
55,144,I'm goin' to give it to ya.
55,145,What would ya like?
55,146,Paddie's like
55,147,'Oh gee Mary. That's
55,148,a very sweet offer.
55,149,Now in 50 years
55,150,there's one thing
55,151,that's been missing
55,152,and uh
55,153,I would like you to
55,154,give me a blow job.
55,155,I would like for it.'
55,156,Mary's like 'All right.'
55,157,She takes her teeth out
55,158,puts 'em in the glass.
55,159,She gives him a blow job.
55,160,Afterwards Paddie's like
55,161,'Yeah geez now that's
55,162,what I've been missin'.
55,163,That was the most beautiful
55,164,earth-shattering thing ever!
55,165,Beautiful Mary! I love ya!
55,166,Is there anything that
55,167,I can do for you?'
55,168,Mary looks up to
55,169,him and she goes
55,170,'Give us a kiss.'
55,171,Oh!
55,172,Oh my God!
55,173,That's filthy.
55,174,It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.
55,175,Get off of me!
55,176,All right. See you guys later.
55,177,All right. Take it easy Bill.
55,178,So Skylar thanks
55,179,for comin' by.
55,180,Changed my opinion
55,181,of Harvard people.
55,182,You don't want to rush
55,183,to judgement on that one
55,184,'cause they're not all like me.
55,185,Oh. I'm sure. It
55,186,was nice to meet ya.
55,187,Oh.
55,188,Take it easy.
55,189,Oh come on.
55,190,Slowly back away.
55,191,Brother.
55,192,I don't know what you're doin' dude.
55,193,You're givin' us a ride.
55,194,What the fuck do I

55,196,Come on Chuck.
55,197,You're walkin' bitch.
55,198,Will's takin' the car.
55,199,All right thanks sucker.
55,200,I appreciate it.
55,201,I don't know what you're
55,202,gettin' all serious about.
55,203,You're droppin' me off first.
55,204,It's really out of the way.
55,205,Oh okay. Just
55,206,'cause you don't have
55,207,to sleep in your one-room
55,208,palace tonight...
55,209,don't start thinkin' you're bad.
55,210,Hey wait a minute. You said
55,211,we were gonna see your place.
55,212,Not tonight.
55,213,Oh no not tonight. Not any other night.
55,214,He knows once you
55,215,see that shit-hole
55,216,he's gettin' dropped
55,217,like a bad habit.
55,218,But I wanted to

55,220,We're gonna do
55,221,that another time.
55,222,All right.
55,223,Need them keys.
55,224,The stewardess hears this
55,225,and goes haulin'
55,226,ass down the aisle.
55,227,I yell
55,228,'Don't forget the coffee.'
55,229,No shit!
55,230,You didn't say that.
55,231,For Christ's sake
55,232,Marty it's a joke.
55,233,I know someone that
55,234,actually happened to Marty.
55,235,A joke.

55,242,How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
55,243,Pleased to meet you.
55,244,Can I get you a beer?
55,245,Um no just a Perrier.
55,246,That's French for club soda.
55,247,Club soda yeah.
55,248,Couple of sandwiches too.
55,249,Sure.
55,250,Put it on my tab.
55,251,You ever plannin'
55,252,on payin' your tab?
55,253,Yeah chief got the winning
55,254,lottery ticket right here.
55,255,What's the jackpot?
55,256,Twelve million.
55,257,I don't think that'll cover it.
55,258,It'll cover your sex
55,259,change operation.
55,260,Nuts?
55,261,No thank you.
55,262,So you wanted to
55,263,talk about Will.
55,264,Well it seems to be going well.
55,265,I think so.
55,266,Have you talked to him
55,267,at all about his future?
55,268,No we haven't
55,269,gotten into that yet.
55,270,We're still bangin'
55,271,away at the past.
55,272,Maybe you should.
55,273,My phone's been ringing off
55,274,the hook with job offers.
55,275,What kind?
55,276,Cutting edge mathematics
55,277,think tanks. The kind
55,278,of place where a mind
55,279,like Will's is given free rein.
55,280,That's great that
55,281,there are offers
55,282,but I don't really think
55,283,he's ready for that.
55,284,I'm not sure you
55,285,understand Sean.
55,286,What don't I understand?
55,287,Here you go guys.
55,288,Thanks Tim.
55,289,Yeah thank you.
55,290,Just so you don't
55,291,get sticky fingers.
55,292,Tim can you help us?

55,296,Sure. Cured polio.
55,297,Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
55,298,Hey.

55,300,Ever heard of him?
55,301,No.
55,302,Thank you Tim.
55,303,So who won the bet?
55,304,I did.
55,305,This isn't about me Sean.
55,306,I'm nothing compared
55,307,to this young man.
55,308,You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?
55,309,In 1905 there were
55,310,hundreds of professors
55,311,renown for their
55,312,study of the universe.
55,313,But it was a 26-year-old
55,314,Swiss patent clerk
55,315,doing physics in his spare
55,316,time who changed the world.
55,317,Can you imagine if Einstein
55,318,would have given that up...
55,319,just to get drunk with his
55,320,buddies in Vienna every night.
55,321,We all would have
55,322,lost something.
55,323,Tim would never
55,324,have heard of him.
55,325,Pretty dramatic Gerry.
55,326,No it isn't Sean.
55,327,This boy has that gift.
55,328,He just doesn't
55,329,got the direction
55,330,but we can give that to him.
55,331,Hey Gerry
55,332,in the 1960s there
55,333,was a young man
55,334,graduated from
55,335,University of Michigan.
55,336,Did some brilliant
55,337,work in mathematics.
55,338,Specifically bounded
55,339,harmonic functions.
55,340,Then he went on to Berkeley.
55,341,He was assistant professor.
55,342,Showed amazing potential.
55,343,Then he moved to Montana and
55,344,he blew the competition away.
55,345,Yeah so who was he?
55,346,Ted Kaczynski.
55,347,Haven't heard of him.
55,348,Hey Timmy!
55,349,Yo!
55,350,Who's Ted Kaczynski?
55,351,Unabomber.
55,352,That's exactly what
55,353,I'm talking about.
55,354,We gotta give this kid direction.
55,355,Yeah...
55,356,He can contribute to the world
55,357,and we can help him do that.
55,358,Direction's one thing.
55,359,Manipulation's another.
55,360,Sean!
55,361,We have to let him find...
55,362,I'm not sitting at
55,363,home every night
55,364,twisting my moustache
55,365,and hatching a...
55,366,hatching a plan to
55,367,ruin this boy's life!
55,368,I was doing advanced mathematics
55,369,when I was 18 and it
55,370,still took me over 20 years
55,371,to do something worthy
55,372,of a Field's medal.
55,373,Maybe he doesn't
55,374,want what you want.
55,375,There's more to life than
55,376,a fuckin' Field's medal.
55,377,This is too important Sean
55,378,and it's above personal rivalry.
55,379,Wait a minute. Wait
55,380,a minute Gerry.
55,381,Let's talk about the boy.
55,382,Why don't we give him time
55,383,to figure out what he wants?
55,384,That's a wonderful theory Sean.
55,385,It worked wonders
55,386,for you didn't it?
55,387,Yeah it did you
55,388,arrogant fuckin' prick!
55,389,Oh I'm sorry.
55,390,I'm sorry that I
55,391,came here today.
55,392,I came here out of courtesy.
55,393,I wanted to keep
55,394,you in the loop.
55,395,Nice to be in the loop.
55,396,The boy's in a meeting right now
55,397,I set up for him over at McNeil.
55,398,Well Will
55,399,I'm not exactly
55,400,sure what you mean.
55,401,We've already offered
55,402,you a position.
55,403,Nobody in this town works
55,404,without a retainer guys.
55,405,You think you can find
55,406,somebody who does
55,407,you have my blessin'.
55,408,But I think we all
55,409,know that person
55,410,is not gonna represent
55,411,you as well as I can.
55,412,Will our offer
55,413,is $84000 a year.
55,414,Retainer!
55,415,Retainer.
55,416,You want us...
55,417,to give you cash right now?
55,418,Whoa-ho-ho. Easy...
55,419,Now I didn't say that.
55,420,Allegedly
55,421,your situation
55,422,for you
55,423,would be concurrently
55,424,improved...
55,425,if I had...
55,426,$200 in my back
55,427,pocket right now.
55,428,I don't think I can...
55,429,Larry?
55,430,I've got $73.
55,431,Will you take a check?
55,432,Let me tell you somethin'.
55,433,You're suspect.
55,434,Yeah you.
55,435,I don't know what your
55,436,reputation is in this town
55,437,but after the shit you
55,438,tried to pull today
55,439,you can bet I'll be
55,440,lookin' into you.
55,441,Now
55,442,any business we have heretofore
55,443,you can speak with my
55,444,aforementioned attorney.
55,445,Good day gentlemen.
55,446,And until that day comes
55,447,keep your ear to the grindstone.
56,0,How's it goin'?
56,1,Fine.
56,2,Yeah.
56,3,Good.
56,4,Want some help?
56,5,No!
56,6,Come on. Give me
56,7,one little peek
56,8,No.
56,9,and we'll go to
56,10,the batting cages.
56,11,It is actually important
56,12,that I learn this.
56,13,It's really important...
56,14,All right.
56,15,to me okay?
56,16,All right.
56,17,Why don't we just
56,18,hang out here all day?
56,19,Yes why don't we?
56,20,All right Mr. Nosey Parker.
56,21,Seeing as you're intent
56,22,on breaking my balls
56,23,let me ask you a question.
56,24,All right.
56,25,Do you have a
56,26,photographic memory?
56,27,I don't know. I just kind
56,28,of remember you know?
56,29,I mean how do you
56,30,remember your phone number?
56,31,You just do.
56,32,Have you studied
56,33,organic chemistry?
56,34,A little bit.
56,35,Oh just for fun?
56,36,Yeah for kicks.
56,37,Yeah it's so much fun
56,38,studying organic chemistry.
56,39,Are you mad?
56,40,Have you completely
56,41,lost your mind?
56,42,Nobody studies it for fun.
56,43,It's not a necessity
56,44,especially for someone like you.
56,45,Someone like me?
56,46,Yeah.
56,47,Someone who divides their
56,48,time fairly evenly
56,49,between batting cages and bars.
56,50,I would hardly say
56,51,it was a necessity.
56,52,You know there are very
56,53,smart people here at Harvard.
56,54,Even they have to study
56,55,because this is really hard.
56,56,And yet...
56,57,you do it so easily.
56,58,I don't understand.
56,59,I don't understand
56,60,how your mind works.
56,61,Did you play the piano?
56,62,I want to talk about this.
56,63,No I'm trying to explain it to you.
56,64,Do you play the piano?
56,65,Yeah a bit.
56,66,All right. So when you look at a
56,67,piano you see Mozart.
56,68,I see 'Chopsticks'.
56,69,All right well
56,70,Beethoven okay?
56,71,He looked at a piano
56,72,and it just made sense to him.
56,73,He could just play.
56,74,So what are you saying?
56,75,You play the piano?
56,76,Not a lick. I look at a piano
56,77,I see a bunch of keys three
56,78,pedals and a box of wood.
56,79,But Beethoven Mozart...
56,80,They saw it. They
56,81,could just play.
56,82,I couldn't paint you a picture.
56,83,I probably can't hit
56,84,the ball out of Fenway.
56,85,And I can't play the piano.
56,86,But you can do my O-chem
56,87,paper in under an hour.
56,88,Right. Well I mean when
56,89,it came to stuff like that
56,90,I could always just play.
56,91,That's the best
56,92,I can explain it.
56,93,Come here.
56,94,I have to tell you something.
56,95,I have to tell you something.
56,96,Well...
57,0,It's not fair.
57,1,What's not fair? What?
57,2,I've been here for four years
57,3,and I've only just found you.
57,4,Well you found me.
58,0,Are you awake?
58,1,No.
58,2,Yes you are.
59,0,What?
59,1,I want you to come to
59,2,California with me.
60,0,You sure about that?
60,1,Oh yeah.
60,2,Yeah but how do you know?
60,3,I don't know.
60,4,I just know.
60,5,Yeah but how do you know?
60,6,I know because...
60,7,I feel it.
60,8,Because that's a really
60,9,serious thing you're saying.
60,10,I... I know.
60,11,You could be in
60,12,California next week...
60,13,and you might find out something
60,14,about me you don't like.
60,15,Maybe you wish you
60,16,hadn't said that
60,17,but you know it's such a serious
60,18,thing you can't take it back.
60,19,Now I'm stuck in California
60,20,with someone that doesn't
60,21,really want to be with me
60,22,just wish they had a take-back.
60,23,A what?
60,24,What's a take-back?
60,25,I don't want a take-back.
60,26,I just want you to come
60,27,to California with me.
60,28,Well I can't go to
60,29,California with you so...
60,30,Why not?
60,31,Well one because I...
60,32,I got a job here.
60,33,And two because I live here.
60,34,Look um
60,35,if you don't love me you
60,36,should just tell me because I...
60,37,I'm not sayin' I don't love you.
60,38,Then why?
60,39,Why won't you come?
60,40,What are you so scared of?
60,41,What am I so scared of?
60,42,Well
60,43,what aren't you scared of?
60,44,You live in this safe little
60,45,world where no one challenges you
60,46,and you're scared shit
60,47,just to do anything that...
60,48,Don't tell me about my world.
60,49,Don't tell me about my world.
60,50,I mean you just want to have
60,51,your little fling
60,52,with the guy from the
60,53,other side of town.
60,54,Then you're gonna
60,55,go off to Stanford.
60,56,You're gonna marry
60,57,some rich prick...
60,58,who your parents
60,59,will approve of...
60,60,and just sit around with the
60,61,other trust fund babies...
60,62,and talk about how you
60,63,went slummin' too once.
60,64,Why are you saying this?
60,65,What is your obsession
60,66,with this money?
60,67,My father died when I was 13
60,68,and I inherited this money.
60,69,You don't think
60,70,every day I wake up
60,71,and I wish I could give it back.
60,72,That I would give
60,73,it back in a second
60,74,if it meant I could have
60,75,one more day with him.
60,76,But I can't
60,77,and that's my life
60,78,and I deal with it.
60,79,So don't put your shit on me
60,80,when you're the
60,81,one that's afraid.
60,82,I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
60,83,What the fuck am I afraid of?
60,84,You're afraid of me.
60,85,You're afraid that I
60,86,won't love you back.
60,87,You know what? I'm afraid too.
60,88,But fuck it I want
60,89,to give it a shot.
60,90,At least I'm honest with you.
60,91,I'm not honest with you?
60,92,No what about your 12 brothers?
60,93,All right.
60,94,No you're not going.
60,95,You're not leaving.
60,96,What do you want to know?
60,97,That I don't have 12 brothers?
60,98,That I'm a fuckin' orphan?
60,99,You don't want to hear that.
60,100,I didn't know that.
60,101,You don't want to hear
60,102,that I got fuckin'
60,103,cigarettes put out on me
60,104,when I was a little kid.
60,105,I didn't know that.
60,106,That this isn't fuckin' surgery.
60,107,The mother fucker stabbed me.
60,108,You don't want to hear
60,109,that shit Skylar!
60,110,I do want to hear that.
60,111,Don't tell me you want that shit!
60,112,I want to hear because
60,113,I want to help you.
60,114,Because I want to be...
60,115,Help me? What the fuck?
60,116,What do I got
60,117,a fuckin' sign on my back
60,118,that says 'Save me'?
60,119,No.
60,120,Do I look like I need that?
60,121,No I just want to be with you.
60,122,Don't bullshit me!
60,123,I love you.
60,124,Don't bullshit me! Don't
60,125,you fuckin' bullshit me!
60,126,I love you.
60,127,I want to hear you say
60,128,that you don't love me.
60,129,Because if you say that...
60,130,then I won't call you...
60,131,and I won't be in your life.
61,0,I don't love you.
62,0,Most people never get to see
62,1,how brilliant they can be.
62,2,They don't find teachers
62,3,that believe in them.
62,4,They get convinced
62,5,they're stupid.
62,6,I hope you appreciate
62,7,what he's doing
62,8,because I've seen how much
62,9,he enjoys working with you
62,10,not against you.
63,0,Hello Will.
63,1,Tom can you get us some coffee?
63,2,Sure.
63,3,Now let's see.
64,0,Good.
64,1,This is correct.
64,2,I see you used Maclaurin here.
64,3,Yeah I don't know what
64,4,you call it but...
64,5,This can't be right.
64,6,This would be very embarrassing.
64,7,Did you ever consider...
64,8,I'm pretty sure it's right.
64,9,Hey look
64,10,can we do this at Sean's office
64,11,from now on? Because I...
64,12,got to knock off
64,13,work to come here
64,14,and the commute is killin' me.
64,15,Yeah sure.
64,16,Did you think of the possibility.
64,17,That's right.
64,18,It's right.
64,19,Just take it home with you.
64,20,What happened at
64,21,the McNeil meeting?
64,22,I couldn't go. I had a date.
64,23,So I sent my chief negotiator.
64,24,On your own time you can
64,25,do whatever you like Will.
64,26,But when I set up a meeting
64,27,with my associates
64,28,and you don't show up
64,29,it reflects poorly on me.
64,30,Then don't set up any more meetings.
64,31,I won't.
64,32,I'll cancel 'em.
64,33,I'll give you a job myself.
64,34,I just wanted you to
64,35,see what was out there.
64,36,Maybe I don't want
64,37,to spend the rest
64,38,of my fuckin' life
64,39,explainin' shit to people.
65,0,I think you could show
65,1,me some appreciation.
65,2,A little appreciation?
65,3,Do you know how
65,4,easy this is for me?
65,5,Do you have any fuckin'
65,6,idea how easy this is?
65,7,This is a fuckin' joke.
65,8,I'm sorry you can't do this.
65,9,I really am...
65,10,Because I wouldn't have
65,11,to fuckin' sit here
65,12,and watch you fumble
65,13,around and fuck it up.
66,0,Then you'd have more
66,1,time to sit around
66,2,and get drunk
66,3,instead wouldn't you?
66,4,You're right.
66,5,This is probably a
66,6,total waste of my time.
67,0,You're right Will.
67,1,I can't do this proof
67,2,but you can. And when it comes
67,3,to that it's only about...
67,4,just a handful of
67,5,people in the world...
67,6,who can tell the difference
67,7,between you and me.
67,8,But I'm one of them.
67,9,Sorry.
67,10,Yeah so am I.
67,11,Most days I wish
67,12,I never met you
67,13,because then I could
67,14,sleep at night.
67,15,I didn't have to walk
67,16,around with the knowledge
67,17,that there was someone
67,18,like you out there.
68,0,I didn't have to watch
68,1,you throw it all away.
69,0,Bill hold it.
69,1,Did you hear that?
69,2,Morgan!
69,3,If you're watchin' pornos
69,4,in my mom's room again
69,5,I'm gonna give you
69,6,a fuckin' beatin'!
70,0,What's up fellas?
70,1,Morgan why don't you jerk
70,2,off in your own fuckin' house.
70,3,That's fuckin' filthy.
70,4,I don't have a V.C.R.
70,5,in my house.
70,6,Come on. Not in my glove.
70,7,I didn't use the glove.
70,8,That's my Little League glove.
70,9,What do you want me to do?
70,10,I mean what's wrong with you?
70,11,You'll hump a baseball glove?
70,12,I just used it for clean-up.
70,13,Stop jerkin' off in
70,14,my mother's room.
70,15,Is there another V.C.R.
70,16,in the house?
70,17,It's just sad bro.
70,18,So why do you
70,19,think I should work
70,20,for the National
70,21,Security Agency?
70,22,Well you'd be working
70,23,on the cutting edge.
70,24,You'd be exposed to
70,25,the kind of technology
70,26,you wouldn't see anywhere else
70,27,because we've classified it.
70,28,Super-string theory chaos math
70,29,advanced algorithms.
70,30,Code breaking.
70,31,That's one aspect of what we do.
70,32,Oh come on. That
70,33,is what you do.
70,34,You guys handle 80% of
70,35,the intelligence workload.
70,36,You're seven times
70,37,the size of the C.I.A.
70,38,We don't like to brag
70,39,about that Will
70,40,but you're exactly right.
70,41,So the way I see it
70,42,the question isn't:
70,43,'Why should you work
70,44,for the N.S.A.?'
70,45,The question is:
70,46,'Why shouldn't you?'
70,47,Why shouldn't I
70,48,work for the N.S.A.?
70,49,That's a tough one
70,50,but I'll take a shot.
70,51,Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
70,52,and somebody puts
70,53,a code on my desk.
70,54,Something no one else can break.
70,55,Maybe I take a shot at
70,56,it and maybe I break it.
70,57,I'm real happy with myself
70,58,because I did my job well.
70,59,But maybe that code
70,60,was the location
70,61,of some rebel army in North
70,62,Africa or Middle East.
70,63,Once they have that location
70,64,they bomb the village where
70,65,the rebels are hidin'.
70,66,Fifteen hundred people
70,67,that I never met
70,68,never had no problem
70,69,with get killed.
70,70,Now the politicians are saying
70,71,'Send in the Marines
70,72,to secure the area'
70,73,'cause they don't give a shit.
70,74,It won't be their kid
70,75,over there gettin' shot
70,76,just like it wasn't them
70,77,when their number got called
70,78,'cause they were in
70,79,the National Guard.
70,80,It'll be some kid from
70,81,Southie over there
70,82,takin' shrapnel in the ass.
70,83,He comes back to find the
70,84,plant he used to work at...
70,85,got exported to the
70,86,country he got back from
70,87,and the guy who put the shrapnel
70,88,in his ass got his old job...
70,89,'cause he'll work for 15 cents
70,90,a day and no bathroom breaks.
70,91,Meanwhile he realizes
70,92,the only reason
70,93,he was over there in
70,94,the first place...
70,95,was so we could
70,96,install a government
70,97,that would sell us
70,98,oil at a good price.
70,99,Of course the oil
70,100,companies used a skirmish
70,101,over there to scare up
70,102,domestic oil prices.
70,103,A cute little ancillary
70,104,benefit for them
70,105,but it ain't helpin' my
70,106,buddy at 2.50 a gallon.
70,107,They're takin' their sweet time
70,108,bringin' the oil of course.
70,109,Maybe they even took the liberty
70,110,to hire an alcoholic skipper
70,111,who likes to drink Martinis
70,112,and fuckin' play slalom
70,113,with the icebergs.
70,114,It ain't too long till he
70,115,hits one spills the oil...
70,116,and kills all the sea life
70,117,in the North Atlantic.
70,118,So now my buddy's out of work
70,119,he can't afford to drive
70,120,so he's walkin' to the
70,121,fuckin' job interviews...
70,122,which sucks because
70,123,the shrapnel in his ass
70,124,is givin' him
70,125,chronic haemorrhoids.
70,126,Meanwhile he's starvin'
70,127,'cause every time he tries
70,128,to get a bite to eat
70,129,the only blue plate
70,130,special they're servin'...
70,131,is North Atlantic scrod
70,132,with Quaker State.
70,133,So what did I think?
70,134,I'm holdin' out for
70,135,somethin' better.
70,136,I figure fuck it.
70,137,While I'm at it why
70,138,not just shoot my buddy
70,139,take his job give it
70,140,to his sworn enemy
70,141,hike up gas prices bomb a
70,142,village club a baby seal
70,143,hit the hash pipe and
70,144,join the National Guard?
70,145,I can be elected president.
70,146,You feel like
70,147,you're alone Will?
70,148,What?
70,149,Do you have a soul mate?
70,150,Do I have a...? Define that.
70,151,Somebody who challenges you.
70,152,Uh Chuckie.
70,153,No Chuckie's family. He'd lie
70,154,down in fuckin' traffic for you.
70,155,I'm talking about someone
70,156,who opens up things for you
70,157,touches your soul.
70,158,I got... I got...
70,159,Who?
70,160,I got plenty.
70,161,Well name 'em.
70,162,Shakespeare Nietzsche Frost
70,163,O'Connor Kant Pope Locke...
70,164,That's great. They're all dead.
70,165,Not to me they're not.
70,166,You don't have a lot
70,167,of dialogue with them.
70,168,You can't give
70,169,back to them Will.
70,170,Not without some serious
70,171,smelling salts and a heater.
70,172,That's what I'm saying.
70,173,You'll never have that kind
70,174,of relationship in a world...
70,175,where you're always afraid
70,176,to take the first step
70,177,because all you see is
70,178,every negative thing
70,179,ten miles down the road.
70,180,You gonna take the
70,181,professor's side on this?
70,182,Don't give me a line of shit.
70,183,No.
70,184,I didn't want the job.
70,185,It's not about the job.
70,186,I don't care if you
70,187,work for the government.
70,188,But you can do
70,189,anything you want.
70,190,You are bound by nothing.
70,191,What are you passionate about?
70,192,What do you want?
70,193,There are guys who work their
70,194,entire life layin' brick...
70,195,so their kids have a chance
70,196,at the opportunities
70,197,you have here.
70,198,I didn't ask for this.
70,199,No.
70,200,You were born with it
70,201,so don't cop out behind:
70,202,'I didn't ask for this.'
70,203,What do you mean cop out?
70,204,What's wrong with layin' brick?
70,205,Nothing.
70,206,There's nothin' wrong. That's
70,207,somebody's home I'm buildin'.
70,208,Right. My dad laid brick okay?
70,209,Busted his ass so I
70,210,could have an education.
70,211,Exactly. That's an
70,212,honourable profession.
70,213,What's wrong with
70,214,fixin' somebody's car?
70,215,Someone will get to work
70,216,the next day because of me.
70,217,That's honour in that.
70,218,Yeah there is Will.
70,219,There is honour in that.
70,220,There's honour in takin'
70,221,that 40-minute train ride...
70,222,so those college
70,223,kids could come in
70,224,in the morning and
70,225,their floors are clean.
70,226,And their waste baskets are empty.
70,227,That's real work.
70,228,That's right.
70,229,And that's honourable.
70,230,I'm sure that's why
70,231,you took that job.
70,232,I mean for the honour of it.
70,233,I just have a little
70,234,question here.
70,235,You could be a janitor anywhere.
70,236,Why did you work at
70,237,the most prestigious
70,238,technical college in
70,239,the whole fuckin' world?
70,240,Why did you sneak
70,241,around at night
70,242,and finish other
70,243,people's formulas...
70,244,that only one or two
70,245,people in the world
70,246,could do and then lie about it?
70,247,'Cause I don't see a lot
70,248,of honour in that Will.
70,249,So what do you really wanna do?
71,0,I wanna be a shepherd.
71,1,Really?
71,2,I wanna move up to Nashua
71,3,get a nice little spread
71,4,get some sheep and tend to them.
71,5,Maybe you should go do that.
71,6,What?
71,7,You know if you're
71,8,gonna jerk off
71,9,why don't you just do it
71,10,at home with a moist towel?
71,11,You're chuckin' me?
71,12,Yeah get the fuck outta here.
71,13,No no no time's not up yet.
71,14,Yeah it is.
71,15,I'm not leavin'. No.
71,16,You're not gonna answer
71,17,you're wastin' my time.
71,18,I thought we were friends.
71,19,What do you mean...
71,20,Playtime's over okay?
71,21,Why are you kickin' me out Sean?
71,22,I mean...
71,23,You're lecturin' me on life?
71,24,Look at you you
71,25,fuckin' burnout.
71,26,What winds your clock?
71,27,Workin' with you.
71,28,Where's your soul mate?
71,29,You wanna talk about soul mates?
71,30,Where is she?
71,31,Dead.
71,32,That's right. She's fuckin' dead.
71,33,She fuckin' dies
71,34,and you just cash
71,35,in your chips and you walk away?
71,36,At least I played a hand.
71,37,You played a hand and you lost.
71,38,You lost a big fuckin' hand.
71,39,Some people will lose
71,40,a big hand like that
71,41,and have the sack
71,42,to ante up again.
71,43,Look at me.
71,44,What do you wanna do?
72,0,You and your bullshit.
72,1,You got a bullshit
72,2,answer for everybody.
72,3,But I ask you a
72,4,very simple question
72,5,and you can't give
72,6,me a straight answer
72,7,because you don't know.
72,8,I'll see ya Bo-peep.
72,9,Fuck you.
72,10,You're the shepherd.
73,0,Shepherd.
73,1,White little prick.
73,2,I just wanted to you know um
73,3,call you up uh
73,4,before you left um...
73,5,I've been takin' all these
73,6,jobs interviews and stuff
73,7,so I'm not gonna be just
73,8,a construction worker.
73,9,Well you know I never
73,10,really cared about that.
73,11,Yeah.
73,12,I love you.
74,0,Will?
74,1,You take care.
74,2,Bye.
75,0,Will!
75,1,Will that's it! We're done!
75,2,I'm sitting in your office
75,3,and the boy isn't here.
75,4,Well it's ten past 5:00.
75,5,An hour and ten minutes late.
75,6,Well if he doesn't show up
75,7,and I file a report
75,8,saying he wasn't here...
75,9,and he goes back to jail he
75,10,won't be on my conscience.
75,11,Okay.
75,12,Fine.
75,13,What's up?
75,14,Thanks.
75,15,Ah!
75,16,God that's good.
75,17,So how's your lady?
75,18,Ah she's gone.
75,19,Gone? Gone where?
75,20,Med school.
75,21,Medical school in California.
75,22,Really?
75,23,Yeah.
75,24,When was this?
75,25,It was like a week ago.
76,0,That sucks.
76,1,So uh when are you
76,2,done with those meetings?
76,3,I think the week after I'm 21.
76,4,They gonna hook ya up
76,5,with a job or what?
76,6,Yeah fuckin' sit in a room
76,7,and do long division
76,8,for the next 50 years.
76,9,Nah probably make
76,10,some nice bank though.
76,11,I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.
76,12,Better than this shit.
76,13,Way outta here.
76,14,What do I want a
76,15,way outta here for?
76,16,I mean I'm gonna fuckin'
76,17,live here the rest of my life.
76,18,You know be neighbours.
76,19,You know have little kids.
76,20,Fuckin' take 'em to Little
76,21,League together up Foley Field.
76,22,Look you're my best friend so
76,23,don't take this the wrong way.
76,24,But in 20 years if
76,25,you're still livin' here
76,26,comin' over to my house to
76,27,watch the Patriots games
76,28,still workin' construction
76,29,I'll fuckin' kill ya.
76,30,That's not a threat. That's a fact.
76,31,I'll fuckin' kill ya.
76,32,What the fuck are
76,33,you talkin' about?
76,34,Look
76,35,you got something
76,36,none of us have.
76,37,Oh come on! Why
76,38,is it always this?
76,39,I mean I fuckin' owe it to
76,40,myself to do this or that.
76,41,What if I don't want to?
76,42,No no no. Fuck you. You
76,43,don't owe it to yourself.
76,44,You owe it to me
76,45,'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
76,46,wake up and I'll be 50
76,47,and I'll still be
76,48,doin' this shit.
76,49,That's all right. That's fine.
76,50,I mean you're sittin' on
76,51,a winnin' lottery ticket.
76,52,You're too much of a
76,53,pussy to cash it in
76,54,and that's bullshit.
76,55,'Cause I'd do fuckin'
76,56,anything to have what you got.
76,57,So would any of
76,58,these fuckin' guys.
76,59,Be an insult to us if you're
76,60,still here in 20 years.
76,61,Hangin' around here is a
76,62,fuckin' waste of your time.
76,63,You don't know that.
76,64,I don't?
76,65,No. You don't know that.
76,66,Oh I don't know that.
76,67,Let me tell you what I do know.
76,68,Every day I come by your
76,69,house and I pick you up.
76,70,We go out and have a few drinks
76,71,and few laughs and it's great.
76,72,You know what the best
76,73,part of my day is?
76,74,It's for about ten seconds:
76,75,from when I pull up to the curb
76,76,and when I get to your door.
76,77,'Cause I think maybe
76,78,I'll get up there
76,79,and I'll knock on the door
76,80,and you won't be there.
76,81,No 'good-bye' no 'see ya later'.
76,82,No nothing.
76,83,You just left.
76,84,I don't know much
76,85,but I know that.
77,0,This is a disaster Sean.
77,1,I brought you in here because
77,2,I wanted you to help
77,3,me with the boy
77,4,not to run him out.
77,5,I know what I'm doing with the boy.
77,6,I don't care if you have
77,7,a rapport with the boy!
77,8,I don't care if you have a few
77,9,laughs even at my expense.
77,10,But don't you dare undermine
77,11,what I'm trying to do here.
77,12,Undermine?
77,13,This boy is at a
77,14,fragile point right now.
77,15,I do understand. He is at a fragile point.
77,16,Okay? He's got problems.
77,17,What problems does
77,18,he have Sean?
77,19,That he's better off as a janitor
77,20,that he is better off in jail?
77,21,Better hanging out with a
77,22,bunch of retarded gorillas?
77,23,Why do you think he
77,24,does that Gerry?
77,25,You have any fuckin' clue why?
77,26,He can handle the problems.
77,27,He can handle the work.
77,28,He obviously handled you.
77,29,Gerry Listen. Listen to me.
77,30,Why is he hiding?
77,31,Why doesn't he trust anybody?
77,32,Because the first thing
77,33,that happened to him
77,34,he was abandoned by the people
77,35,who were supposed to
77,36,love him the most.
77,37,Come on. Don't give
77,38,me that Freudian crap.
77,39,Oh no. Listen Gerry
77,40,why does he hang out with those
77,41,retarded gorillas
77,42,as you call them?
77,43,Because any one of them
77,44,if he asked them to
77,45,would take a fucking
77,46,bat to your head. Okay?
77,47,That's called loyalty.
77,48,Yeah that's very touching.
77,49,And who's he handling?
77,50,He pushes people away
77,51,before they have a
77,52,chance to leave him.
77,53,It's a defence
77,54,mechanism all right?
77,55,For 20 years he's been
77,56,alone because of that.
77,57,If you push him right now
77,58,it's gonna be the same
77,59,thing all over again.
77,60,And I'm not gonna let
77,61,that happen to him.
77,62,Don't you do that Sean.
77,63,What?
77,64,Don't you do that. Don't
77,65,infect him with the idea
77,66,that it's okay to quit that
77,67,it's okay to be a failure.
77,68,Because it's not okay Sean!
77,69,And if you're angry at
77,70,me for being successful
77,71,for being what you
77,72,could have been...
77,73,I'm not angry at you.
77,74,Oh yes you're angry at me Sean.
77,75,You resent me
77,76,but I'm not gonna apologize
77,77,for any success I've had.
77,78,You're angry at me for doing
77,79,what you could have done!
77,80,But ask yourself
77,81,Sean ask yourself...
77,82,ask yourself if you want
77,83,Will to feel that way
77,84,if you want him to
77,85,feel like a failure?
77,86,You arrogant shit!
77,87,That's why I don't come
77,88,to the goddamn reunions
77,89,'cause I can't stand
77,90,that look in your eye.
77,91,You know that condescending
77,92,embarrassed look.
77,93,Oh come on Sean.
77,94,You think I'm a failure.
77,95,I know who I am.
77,96,I'm proud of what I do.
77,97,It was a conscious choice.
77,98,I didn't fuck up!
77,99,And you and your cronies think
77,100,I'm some sort of pity case.
77,101,You and your kiss-ass chorus
77,102,following you around going 'The
77,103,Field's medal!' The Field's Medal!'
77,104,Why are you still so
77,105,fuckin' afraid of failure?
77,106,It's about my medal isn't it?
77,107,Oh God I could go home and get it for you.
77,108,You can have it.
77,109,Oh please don't. You know what!
77,110,Shove the medal up your
77,111,fuckin' ass all right?
77,112,'Cause I don't give a
77,113,shit about your medal
77,114,because I knew you before
77,115,you were a mathematical god
77,116,when you were
77,117,pimple-faced and homesick
77,118,and didn't know what side
77,119,of the bed to piss on.
77,120,Yeah you were
77,121,smarter than me then
77,122,and you're smarter than me now.
77,123,So don't blame me for how your
77,124,life turned out. It's not my fault.
77,125,I don't blame you!
77,126,It's not about you!
77,127,You mathematical dick!
77,128,It's about the boy!
77,129,He's a good kid! And I
77,130,won't see you fuck him up
77,131,like you're tryin' to
77,132,fuck up me right now.
77,133,I won't see you make him
77,134,feel like a failure too!
77,135,He won't be a failure!
77,136,But if you push him Gerry
77,137,if you ride him...
77,138,I am what I am today
77,139,because I was pushed
77,140,and because I learned
77,141,to push myself.
77,142,He's not you! You get that!
77,143,I can come back.
77,144,No come in. Uh...
77,145,I was just leaving.
78,0,A lot of that stuff goes back
78,1,a long way between me and him.
78,2,You know.
78,3,Not about you.
79,0,What is that?
79,1,This is your file.
79,2,I have to send it back to
79,3,the judge for evaluation.
79,4,Oh.
79,5,Hey you're not gonna
79,6,fail me are you?
79,7,What's it say?
79,8,Wanna read it?
79,9,Why?
79,10,Have you had any uh
79,11,experience with that?
79,12,Twenty years of counselling.
79,13,Yeah I've seen some
