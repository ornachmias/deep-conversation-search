2
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,753
So please finish
Percival for next time.

3
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,391
I know many of you had
this as undergraduates,

4
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:46,861
but it won't hurt to brush up.

5
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,446
Thank you, Steven.

6
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:57,130
I also put an advanced
Fourier system

7
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,249
on the main hallway chalkboard.

8
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:00,949
I'm hoping that one of you

9
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,256
might prove it by the
end of the semester.

10
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,372
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

11
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,794
but also go on to
fame and fortune...

12
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:11,285
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

13
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,269
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

14
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,886
Former winners include
Nobel laureates,

15
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,428
Field's medal winners...

16
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,813
renowned astrophysicists

17
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,897
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

18
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:24,867
Well, that's all.

19
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,580
If you have any questions...

20
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,904
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

21
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,929
Hi, Will.

22
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,756
-Kirsten, how you doing?
-I'm all right. How are you?

23
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:10,773
Good.

24
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,987
I didn't get on
Cathy last night.

25
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,391
-No?
-No.

26
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,151
-Why not?
-I don't know.

27
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,160
-Cathy!
-What?

28
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,704
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

29
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,123
-you usually throw at me?
-Oh, fuck you...

30
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,585
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.

31
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,115
Like I'd waste my
energy spreading my legs

32
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:29,589
for that Tootsie Roll dick?

33
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:33,051
-Go home and give it a tug yourself.
-Tootsie Roll!

34
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:34,907
T-Toots!

35
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,428
She's missing a tooth, Will.

36
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,522
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

37
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,984
Plus, it's like 5-to-2
Morgan ends up marrying her,

38
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:44,640
you know what I mean?

39
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,618
There's only so many times

40
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,381
you can bang your
friend's future wife.

41
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:48,855
It's wrong.

42
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:50,284
Where you going?

43
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,589
I'm gonna take off.

44
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,857
Fuck you, you're taking off.
It's, like, what, 10:00?

45
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:55,725
No, I'm tired.

46
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,864
Irish curse?

47
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,564
She don't know.

48
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:04,349
There ain't no Irish curse.

49
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,498
Out! Stop pressuring me back.

50
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,879
Stop crowding the plate!

51
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,210
Which one will it be?

52
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,297
You're gonna get
charged, you know that?

53
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:24,856
You think I'm afraid
of you, you big fuck?

54
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:26,630
You're crowding
the fuckin' plate.

55
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,920
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncing up
a bar at Harvard next week.

56
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,732
We should go up there.

57
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:33,008
What are we gonna do up there?

58
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,093
I don't know.

59
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,322
We'll fuck up some smart kids.

60
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,130
Probably fit right in.

61
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,470
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

62
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,353
-Oh, what's up? You still tough?
-Come on!

63
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,661
Come on. Come on. That's it.

64
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,988
-Professor Lambeau?
-Yes?

65
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,710
I'm in your applied
theories class.

66
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,562
We're all up at the math
and science building.

67
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,680
Come here.

68
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:08,095
It's Saturday.

69
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,619
Unless you wanna have a
drink with me tonight.

70
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:12,115
Maybe.

71
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:14,703
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

72
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:15,979
Find out what?

73
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:17,527
Who proved the theorem.

74
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,211
This is correct.

75
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:44,110
Who did this?

76
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,357
Jack?

77
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,720
It wasn't me.

78
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,186
Nemesh?

79
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,312
N-No way.

80
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:56,439
-Come on, Joey, now!
-Billy, McNamara's up.

81
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,568
Come on, kid!

82
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:01,029
-Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
-Son of a bitch!

83
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,210
Bring it down, Mac!

84
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,556
That's how to do it! Attaboy!
Take two, Mac.

85
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:09,531
Hey, Morgan,

86
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,097
who's the girl with the striped pants?
She's got a nice ass.

87
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,024
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.

88
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,391
Who's the guy she's with?

89
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,521
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

90
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,671
Yeah, I do.

91
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:21,591
Yeah, fuckin'
Carmine Scarpaglia.

92
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:23,392
That guy used to beat shit
out of me in kindergarten.

93
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,625
-That guy?
-Yeah.

94
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,200
Fuck this. Let's get some food.

95
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,328
Oh, what, Morgan, you're
not gonna go talk to her?

96
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:32,322
Fuck her.

97
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,669
-I could go for a Whopper.
-Let's go to Kelly's.

98
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,655
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's

99
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,044
just 'cause you like
the take-out girl.

100
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,349
It's 15 minutes out of our way.

101
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,483
What the fuck we gonna do?
We can't spare 15 minutes.

102
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,110
Double burger.

103
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,049
Double burger.

104
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,153
Chuck, I had a double burger.

105
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,382
Would you shut the fuck up!

106
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,648
I know what you ordered.
I was there.

107
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,173
So give me my fuckin' sandwich.

108
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:00,734
What do you mean, your sandwich?
I bought it.

109
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:03,070
Morgan, how much
money you got on you?

110
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,483
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

111
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:07,037
I said that when we pulled up.

112
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,219
Give me my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick.

113
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,372
All right, well, give
me your fuckin' 16 cents

114
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:12,436
that you got on you now.

115
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:14,027
We'll put your fuckin'
sandwich on lay-away.

116
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,055
Here we go.

117
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,627
Keep it right up here for ya.

118
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:17,946
We'll put you on a program.

119
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:19,324
Every day you come in
here with your six cents.

120
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,221
At the end of the week,
you get your sandwich.

121
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,592
Are you gonna be an ass hole?

122
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,964
What am I, fuckin'
sandwich welfare?

123
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,930
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

124
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:29,766
Like how you bought your
couch-payment plans.

125
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,641
Remember how your
mother brought in

126
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,474
ten dollars every
day for a year.

127
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,315
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Centre style.

128
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:36,505
Can I have my food, please?

129
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:37,879
Here's your fuckin'
double burger.

130
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,655
-Whoa!
-Hey, hold up, Chuck.

131
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,557
-Slow it down.
-Who do we got?

132
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,891
-I don't know yet.
-Hey, douche bag!

133
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,557
Yeah, you, you skank face!

134
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:50,894
Shut the fuck up

135
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,211
-Get outta here.
-What are you worried about?

136
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,957
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

137
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:58,018
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.

138
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,970
We should've fight him then.
We're eatin' our snacks now.

139
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,046
-Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
-I'm not goin'.

140
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:03,721
So don't go.

141
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:05,145
I'm not goin'.

142
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,458
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

143
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:08,596
Let me tell you somethin'.

144
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:09,805
If you're not out there
in two fuckin' seconds,

145
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,586
when I'm done with
them, you're next.

146
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:14,031
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.

147
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:15,906
Remember, we went to
kindergarten together.

148
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:33,052
-Fuckin', let's go, man.
-Step on his fuckin' head.

149
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:35,050
Get his ass on the ground.

150
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:37,351
Stop that mother fucker.

151
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,817
Mother fucker, die!

152
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,274
-Carter!
-Come on!

153
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,661
Will! Will, come on!

154
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:07,645
Will, come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

155
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:10,518
Easy, brother, easy.

156
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:13,636
-Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
-Come here!

157
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:15,235
Whoa! Whoa!

158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,824
Ah. Fuck.

159
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:32,267
Is it just my imagination,

160
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,550
or has my class
grown considerably?

161
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,450
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

162
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,790
do I believe you've all come
here to hear me lecture.

163
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:42,573
Rather, to ascertain
the identity

164
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,672
of the mystery math magician.

165
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,176
So without further
adieu, come forward,

166
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:50,482
silent rogue, and
receive thy prize.

167
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,879
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

168
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,374
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

169
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,545
However, uh, my colleagues
and I have conferred,

170
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,228
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

171
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:17,437
that took us more than
two years to prove.

172
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,064
So let this be said:

173
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,539
The gauntlet has
been thrown down,

174
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,192
but the faculty have answered

175
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,165
and answered with vigour.

176
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,310
Hey, when's the arraignment?

177
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:42,922
Next week.

178
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:11,341
Sorry.

179
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:12,559
What are you doing?

180
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:13,559
Sorry.

181
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:17,081
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

182
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,758
-Don't you walk away from me!
-Hey, fuck you!

183
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,294
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

184
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,997
Oh, my God.

185
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:55,367
Looks right.

186
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,681
Will, how retarded do you gotta
be to get fired from that job?

187
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,490
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around?

188
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,970
Mitch, you got fired from
pushin' a fuckin' broom.

189
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,129
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

190
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,864
Yeah, restructuring
the amount of retards

191
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:24,901
they had workin' for 'em.

192
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,188
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

193
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,523
At least I got a motherfuckin'
job right now, don't I?

194
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:30,283
Yeah.

195
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,497
Why'd you get fired, Will?
Come on.

196
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,133
Management was restructuring.

197
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,452
My uncle could probably
get you on a demo team.

198
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:38,982
Can he do that?

199
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,259
You kiddin' me!

200
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,779
I asked you yesterday
if I could get a job.

201
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,653
And I told you 'no' yesterday.

202
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:45,063
What's up, Casey?

203
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,715
What's up, Case?
What's up, Big Case?

204
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,149
Let's sit over here.

205
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:53,843
All right. Let's go.

206
00:15:58,753 --> 00:15:59,798
Oh, this is...

207
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,089
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

208
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:05,169
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

209
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,148
I will take a pitcher of the
finest lager in the house.

210
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:18,458
Timeout.

211
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,109
I'm gonna have to
bust a little move

212
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,275
on them Harvard hotties
down there at the bar.

213
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,247
Work some magic.

214
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:24,753
Get some potion for us.

215
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:43,844
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, hello.

216
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,669
-Hi. How are ya?
-Fine.

217
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,125
-So, do you ladies, uh...
-Come here often?

218
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,060
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

219
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,887
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

220
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,249
-Do you go to school here?
-Yep.

221
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:56,381
Yeah.

222
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,219
That's it. I think I
had a class with you.

223
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,523
Oh, yeah. What class?

224
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:02,131
History.

225
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,074
Maybe.

226
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,021
Yes, I think that's what it was.

227
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:06,380
You don't necessarily...

228
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:08,775
may not remember me. You
know, I like it here.

229
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,246
It doesn't mean
'cause I go here,

230
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,601
I'm a genius. I am very smart.

231
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:14,835
-Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
-Good. How ya doin'?

232
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:17,905
What class did you say that was?

233
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,762
-History.
-Yeah.

234
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:21,039
Just history?

235
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,455
It must have been a
survey course then.

236
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:25,140
-Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
-Right.

237
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:26,507
You should check it out.
It's a good course.

238
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:27,495
It'd be a good class.

239
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,930
How'd you like that course?

240
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:31,264
You know, frankly,

241
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:34,087
I found that class, you
know, rather elementary.

242
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:34,983
Elementary.

243
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,877
-You know, I don't doubt that it was.
-Yeah.

244
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:37,675
I, uh,

245
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:40,001
I remember that class.

246
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,005
It was, um...

247
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,767
it was just between
recess and lunch.

248
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,438
Clark, why don't you go away?

249
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,761
-Why don't you relax?
-Why don't you go away?

250
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:50,410
I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
That's all.

251
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:51,458
Are we gonna have a problem?

252
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,557
No, no, no, no. There's
no problem here.

253
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,282
I was just hoping you
might give me some insight

254
00:17:56,343 --> 00:18:00,245
into the evolution of the market
economy in the southern colonies.

255
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,498
My contention is that prior
to the Revolutionary War,

256
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,596
the economic
modalities, especially,

257
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,397
in the southern colonies...

258
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,108
could most aptly be
characterized as...

259
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,110
-agrarian pre-capitalist.
-Let me tell you somethin'.

260
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,416
Of course that's
your contention.

261
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:16,586
You're a first-year
grad student.

262
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,048
You just got finished readin'
some Marxian historian,

263
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,327
Pete Garrison, probably...

264
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:21,855
You're gonna be convinced
of that till next month

265
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,911
when you get to James Lemon.

266
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:24,107
Then you're gonna
be talkin' about

267
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,041
how the economies of
Virginia and Pennsylvania...

268
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,134
were entrepreneurial and
capitalist way back in 1740.

269
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,496
That's gonna last
until next year.

270
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,546
You're gonna be in here
regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

271
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:33,905
talkin' about, you know,

272
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,843
the pre-revolutionary utopia...

273
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,666
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

274
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,624
Well, as a matter
of fact, I won't,

275
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,472
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of...

276
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:48,216
Wood drastically underestimates the
impact of social distinctions...

277
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,766
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

278
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:55,139
You got that from Vickers' Work
in Essex County. Page 98, right?

279
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,724
I read that too.

280
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,437
Were you gonna plagiarize
the whole thing for us?

281
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,307
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

282
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,126
Or is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

283
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:05,315
You read some obscure passage.

284
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,704
Then pretend... pawn
it off as your own.

285
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,448
As your own idea just
to impress some girls?

286
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,687
Embarrass my friend?

287
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,679
See, the sad thing about a
guy like you is, in 50 years,

288
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:17,401
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

289
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:18,273
You're gonna come
up with the fact

290
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,581
that there are two
certainties in life.

291
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,496
One: Don't do that.

292
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,356
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

293
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,483
you could've got for $1.50 in late
charges at the public library.

294
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,553
Yeah, but I will have a degree,

295
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,032
and you'll be
servin' my kids fries

296
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,405
at a drive through on
our way to a skiing trip.

297
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:39,602
Maybe,

298
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,665
but at least I
won't be unoriginal.

299
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,319
If you have a problem with that,

300
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,710
we could step outside.
We could figure it out.

301
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,242
No, man, there's no problem.

302
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:51,620
It's cool.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,114
-It's cool?
-Yeah.

304
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:53,680
Cool.

305
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:55,681
Damn right, it's cool.

306
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:56,941
How do you like me now?

307
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,272
My boy's wicked smart.

308
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,053
I just spent three minutes
in this fuckin' place

309
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,631
and run into a Barney, huh?

310
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,356
There it is.

311
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:13,334
-Nice to meet you.
-They were fine, man.

312
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,340
I was gonna close
the deal, but then...

313
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,922
Chuck... Billy, uh...
insulted one of 'em...

314
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,630
The heavyset girl said I
had a receding hairline,

315
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:21,863
and I was a few
pounds overweight.

316
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,289
And I was, like,
'Go fuck yourself'.

317
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,581
I swallowed a bug.

318
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:28,917
Hi.

319
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,853
You're an idiot.

320
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,138
What?

321
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:34,305
You're an idiot.

322
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,022
I've been sitting over
there for 45 minutes...

323
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,452
waiting for you to
come and talk to me.

324
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,784
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

325
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,800
And... I couldn't sit there
anymore waiting for you.

326
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,609
-I'm Will.
-Skylar.

327
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,612
-Skylar.
-Oh, and by the way,

328
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,686
that guy over there,

329
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:49,823
Michael Bolton clone...

330
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,034
He wasn't sitting
with us, so to speak.

331
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:54,149
I know. I kinda got
that impression.

332
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,455
Good. Okay.

333
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:56,745
Well, I've got to go.

334
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,053
Gotta get up early and
waste some more money

335
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:01,627
on my overpriced education.

336
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,907
-No, I didn't mean you.
-That's all right.

337
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:05,375
There's my number.

338
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:07,697
Maybe we can go out
for coffee sometime.

339
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:08,456
All right, yeah.

340
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,927
Maybe we can just get together
and eat a bunch of caramels.

341
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:12,555
What do you mean?

342
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,907
When you think about it, it's
as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

343
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,438
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

344
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,840
Uh, right, then.

345
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:22,479
Oh, come on.

346
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,822
You're kidding.

347
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,197
Yo!

348
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:30,722
-Fuck you, bitch!
-Fuck you.

349
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,092
There goes them fuckin' barneys

350
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,933
-right now with his skiin' trip.
-Hold on.

351
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:37,338
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

352
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,709
Do you like apples?

353
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,079
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

354
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:53,462
Well, I got her number!

355
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,439
How do you like them apples?

356
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:48,448
Come.

357
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:54,699
Excuse me?

358
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:56,770
Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

359
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,540
Yeah. What can I do for you?

360
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,881
I just need the name of
a student who works here.

361
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,446
No students work for me.

362
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,534
Could you please check?

363
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:06,218
I have this guy who
works in my building.

364
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,588
-He's about this high.
-Which one is your building?

365
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,280
-Two.
-Two. Building two.

366
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,524
Look, if anything was stolen,
I should know about it.

367
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,718
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.
I just need his name.

368
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,892
I can't give you his name
unless you've a complaint.

369
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:27,153
This is Professor Lambeau.

370
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:28,748
And this is Professor Hayes.

371
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:29,909
Tom, please.

372
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,488
This is important.

373
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,001
Please.

374
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,858
Will didn't show for work today.

375
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:43,301
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

376
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,352
P.O.?

377
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,793
Yeah, Parole Officer.

378
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,845
Thank you.

379
00:23:54,764 --> 00:23:55,517
Ass hole.

380
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,836
There is a lengthy
legal precedent,

381
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,091
Your Honour, going back to 1789,

382
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,929
whereby a defendant
can claim self-defence

383
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,313
against an agent of
the government...

384
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,899
if that act is deemed a
defence against tyranny,

385
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,007
a defence of liberty.

386
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,024
Your Honour,

387
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,332
Henry Ward Beecher,

388
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,101
in Proverbs from Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said

389
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:18,303
-1887, this is the 20th century.
-Excuse me.

390
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:19,391
He's gonna make a mockery
of the court room.

391
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,966
I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defence, sir,

392
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,761
by the Constitution
of the United States.

393
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,235
Don't tell me about the
Constitution of the United States.

394
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:27,294
This guarantees my liberty.

395
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,004
'Liberty', in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

396
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:32,729
When it cannot take a long
breath, laws are girded too tight.

397
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,287
-Without liberty, man is a syncope.
-Man is a what?

398
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,075
-Ibid., Your Honour.
-Son, my turn.

399
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,499
I've been sitting here
for ten minutes now

400
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,094
lookin' over this
rap sheet of yours.

401
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,206
I just can't believe it.

402
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,918
June '93, assault.

403
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:49,109
September '93, assault.

404
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:52,260
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

405
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,745
Where, apparently,
you defended yourself

406
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,370
and had the case
thrown out by citing...

407
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:01,539
'free property rights of
horse and carriage' from 1798.

408
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:04,993
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

409
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:08,997
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

410
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:11,005
I'm also aware that you've been

411
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,609
through several foster homes.

412
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:14,615
The state removed you from three

413
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:16,498
because of serious
physical abuse.

414
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:18,483
You know, another
judge might care,

415
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:19,802
but you hit a cop.

416
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:21,342
You're going in.

417
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:23,561
Motion to dismiss is denied.

418
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:25,576
$50,000 bail.

419
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:26,725
Thank you.

420
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:28,615
Rise.

421
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:33,065
-Hello?
-Uh, Skylar?

422
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:35,270
-Yep.
-Hey, uh, it's Will.

423
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:37,028
-Who?
-It's Will.

424
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,071
You know, the really...

425
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,198
funny, good-looking guy you
met at the bar the other night.

426
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:42,781
I don't recall meeting anyone
who matches that description.

427
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,910
I think I'd remember.

428
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,361
Oh, all right, you got me.

429
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:47,456
It's the ugly, obnoxious,
toothless loser...

430
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,746
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

431
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,670
Oh, Will! I remember.

432
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:54,811
How are you?

433
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,417
I was wondering
if you'd call me.

434
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,760
-Yeah, look, I was wondering...
-Yo, what's up, baby?

435
00:25:59,013 --> 00:26:00,431
-Hold on one second.
-What you doing?

436
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:01,437
Hey.

437
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,202
What's up baby?
Want some of my ass?

438
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:06,165
Herve, I remember you from juvi.
How you doing?

439
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:07,263
What you doing?

440
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:09,145
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

441
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,382
I was wonderin' maybe we could

442
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,551
get together sometime this week.

443
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,860
Sit out at a cafe. Maybe
have some caramels.

444
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,671
-Oh, that sounds wonderful.
-Yeah?

445
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:19,241
Yeah, sure. Where are you?

446
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:22,811
Uh, well, actually, this is just
a shot in the dark, but, uh,

447
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,384
there's no chance that
you're pre-law, is there?

448
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:31,385
Have a seat.

449
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:32,607
Thank you.

450
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:35,129
Nice talking to ya.

451
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,236
What the fuck do you want?

452
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

453
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,210
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

454
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,633
Well, what the fuck do you want?

455
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:52,071
I've spoken to the judge,

456
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,588
and he's agreed to release you

457
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,974
under my supervision.

458
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:56,953
-Really?
-Yeah.

459
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,654
-Under two conditions.
-What are those?

460
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:07,167
First condition is that you
meet with me every week.

461
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:08,525
What for?

462
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,090
Go over the proof
you're working on,

463
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:12,180
get into some...

464
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,561
more advanced...

465
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:17,814
combinatorial mathematics,

466
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,948
finite math.

467
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:24,382
Sounds like a real hoot.

468
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:28,498
And the second
condition is that...

469
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:31,377
that you see a therapist.

470
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,609
I'm responsible to submit
reports on those meetings.

471
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:40,897
If you fail...

472
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,981
to meet with any of
those conditions,

473
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,418
you will have to serve time.

474
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,059
All right. I'll do the math,

475
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,106
but I'm not gonna meet
with any fuckin' therapist.

476
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:52,568
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

477
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:59,450
I read your book, and 'Mike'

478
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,976
was havin' the same problems...
that 'Chad',

479
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:03,347
the stockbroker, was havin'.

480
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,246
Absolutely right.
Right on the button.

481
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:06,949
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

482
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:07,659
Thank you.

483
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,927
Will,

484
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:11,552
the pressures, and
I'm not judging them.

485
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,406
I'm not labelling them,

486
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,473
but they are destroying
your potential.

487
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,966
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery.

488
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,621
No more ballyhoo.

489
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:23,557
You're right.

490
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:26,873
God, I know.

491
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:30,443
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will,

492
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:31,283
a bit more.

493
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:33,631
Well, I mean, I do
do things, you know?

494
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:35,416
What... what kind of things?

495
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,082
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

496
00:29:39,762 --> 00:29:40,683
You hide, do you?

497
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:43,836
No, no. I mean, I like. I go places.
I interact, you know.

498
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,540
-Really? What sort of places?
-Just certain clubs.

499
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,874
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

500
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,822
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

501
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:54,043
Fantasy. That's
nice, a bit more.

502
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:56,081
It's something like
when you get in there,

503
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:58,636
the music, like, owns you.

504
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,828
It's like that house music.
It's like...

505
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,728
-You know, you start dancin'.
-Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

506
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:07,597
It's just...

507
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:10,738
Yes.

508
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,984
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

509
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:20,165
What are you talking about?
What?

510
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:21,623
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,

511
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:22,909
you were ready to
give me a jump.

512
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,774
A jump?

513
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:24,789
Are you...

514
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,967
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

515
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,635
Hey, I don't have
a problem with it.

516
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:31,364
I don't care if you
putt from the rough.

517
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,878
What are you...
putting from the rough?

518
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:35,239
What on earth are
you talking about?

519
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:39,661
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

520
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:41,546
It's very erotic.

521
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,995
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

522
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:47,645
-Wow.
-Thank you, Henry.

523
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:49,816
Ah, Henry.

524
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,540
Hi, Gerry.

525
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:52,245
You know something?

526
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,065
I can't do this pro
bono work anymore.

527
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,630
-It's just not... it's not worth it.
-What happened?

528
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,562
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

529
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,872
I mean, I haven't
got time to tell you,

530
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:02,187
much less talk to that
raving looney in there.

531
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:03,643
An absolute lunatic, he is.

532
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:06,176
Henry.

533
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,406
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

534
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:11,382
Now,

535
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:14,026
how old are you?

536
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,290
Seven.

537
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,108
What do you see?

538
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,775
Some things in my room.

539
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,670
What is it?

540
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:30,772
It's like a... it's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

541
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,768
You are in a safe place, Will.

542
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:36,402
It's t...

543
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:38,622
it's touchin' me.

544
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:41,272
Where is it touching you?

545
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,285
It's touching me down there,

546
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:47,922
and I'm nervous.

547
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:50,497
You don't have to
be nervous, Will.

548
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,623
We...

549
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:57,393
start dancin' and dancin'.
It's just beautiful,

550
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:58,796
'cause we...

551
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:04,664
can make... a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

552
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:22,769
-I'm sorry, Rich.
-I have better things to do with my time.

553
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,021
Hey. Afternoon delight.
Come on! One dance!

554
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,333
You really hypnotized
me, you know?

555
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:30,745
For God's sake, Will.

556
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:32,075
What? Oh, come on.

557
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,113
He left. You can't
pin that on me.

558
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,448
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

559
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,618
-Look... into my eyes.
-Get out, Will.

560
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,042
I don't need therapy.

561
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,282
That's enough. Get out!

562
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,798
I called Mel Weintraub
this morning to see...

563
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:48,906
Oh, what's the use?

564
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,332
What do you want to do?

565
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,773
-Well, there's someone.
-Who is he?

566
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:00,369
He used to be my, uh...

567
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,961
my room-mate in college.

568
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,180
Trust.

569
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,125
Very important...

570
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,072
in a relationship. It's also very
important in a clinical situation.

571
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,686
Why is trust the most
important thing...

572
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:19,577
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

573
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:25,600
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

574
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:27,210
Vinnie.

575
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,107
Um...

576
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:31,308
Because, uh...

577
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,394
Trust is, uh...

578
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:36,007
trust is life.

579
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:37,027
Wow.

580
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,470
That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

581
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,516
Next time, get the
notes from your brother.

582
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,547
If a patient doesn't feel
safe enough trust you,

583
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:45,876
then they won't be
honest with you.

584
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:48,027
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

585
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,556
I mean, hey, if they
don't trust you,

586
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,725
you're never gonna get
them to sleep with you.

587
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:53,111
That should be the goal
of any good therapist.

588
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:54,850
Nail 'em while
they're vulnerable.

589
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:55,642
That's my motto.

590
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,816
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

591
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:01,973
Hello, Sean.

592
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:05,113
Hey, Gerry.

593
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:07,755
Um,

594
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:09,841
ladies and gentlemen,

595
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,053
we are in the
presence of greatness.

596
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,723
Professor Gerald Lambeau,

597
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,141
Field's medal winner for
combinatorial mathematics.

598
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,092
Hello.

599
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:18,808
Anyone know what the
Field's medal is?

600
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,119
It's a really big deal.

601
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,855
It's like the Nobel
prize for math.

602
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:24,457
Except they only give it
out once every four years.

603
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:26,986
It's a great thing.

604
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,472
It's an amazing honour.

605
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,276
Okay, everybody,
that's it for today.

606
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,100
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.

607
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:33,976
We'll be talking about Freud.

608
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:35,974
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse.

609
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:36,817
Thank you.

610
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:39,969
How are you?

611
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:41,868
It's good to see you.

612
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:43,236
Good to see you.

613
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:44,464
-Sean?
-Yeah?

614
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,322
I think I got something
interesting for ya.

615
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,629
What, you have to have blood in urine?
What's up?

616
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,222
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

617
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:53,492
You know, I'm...

618
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:54,851
I've been busy.

619
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:56,721
You were missed.

620
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:57,770
Really?

621
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:59,949
So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

622
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,502
Before Nancy died.

623
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:03,879
Yeah, I'm sorry.

624
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:05,875
I was in Paris.

625
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:06,998
It was that damn conference.

626
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,826
I got your card. It was nice.

627
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:16,557
-Come here.
-Now that's a take-down.

628
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,085
Hey, what happened?

629
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,846
Did you get leniency or what?

630
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,116
I got, uh,

631
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:24,135
probation and then
counselling two days a week.

632
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:25,904
Joke.

633
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,848
You're a smoothie. Come on, Morgan!
Just submit!

634
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,113
Hey, Bill, just...

635
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,872
just get off him. We're
gonna miss the game.

636
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,979
-I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
-Sean, Sean.

637
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,892
This...this boy is incredible.

638
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:38,023
I've never seen
anything like him.

639
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:40,177
What makes him so
incredible, Gerry?

640
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:42,996
You ever heard of Ramanujan?

641
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:45,772
No.

643
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,214
It's a man.

644
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,701
He lived over 100 years ago.
He was Indian.

645
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,312
-Dots, not feathers.
-Not feathers. Yeah.

646
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,716
He lived in this tiny
hut somewhere in India.

647
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:57,643
He had no formal education.

648
00:35:58,035 --> 00:36:00,223
-He had no access to any scientific work.
-Coffee?

649
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:01,568
-You, sir?
-Just a little.

650
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,846
But he came across
this old math book,

651
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:06,417
and from the simple text,

652
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,111
he was able to
extrapolate theories...

653
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:09,974
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

654
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,552
Yes. Continued fractions.

655
00:36:11,782 --> 00:36:13,144
He wrote, uh...

656
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,302
Well, he mailed it to
Hardy at Cambridge.

657
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:16,812
Yeah, Cambridge, yeah.

658
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,275
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

659
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,875
And brought him over to England,

660
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,172
and then they worked
together for years,

661
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:27,292
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

662
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:29,329
This... this Ramanujan...

663
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:32,362
his... his genius was
unparalleled, Sean.

664
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,403
Well, this boy's just like that.

665
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,400
But he's... he's
a bit defensive.

666
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:42,867
I need someone who can
get through to him.

667
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:44,687
Like me?

668
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,181
Yeah, like you.

669
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:47,358
Why?

670
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,351
Well, because you have the
same kind of background.

671
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:50,494
What background?

672
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,243
Well, you're from the
same neighbourhood.

673
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,930
He's from Southie?

674
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:54,846
Yeah.

675
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,065
Boy genius from Southie.

676
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,005
How many shrinks
you go to before me?

677
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:03,199
Five.

678
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:06,414
-Let me guess. Barry?
-Yeah.

679
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,349
-Henry?
-Yeah.

680
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,703
-Not Rick?
-Sean, please...

681
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:11,021
, just meet with
him once a week.

682
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,427
Please?

683
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:17,599
It's a poker game with this kid.

684
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,116
Don't let him know
what you've got.

685
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:21,227
He probably even read your book,

686
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,303
if he could find it.

687
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,631
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

688
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:25,915
-Hi, Will.
-Hi.

689
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,681
This is Sean Maguire.

690
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:28,661
Will Hunting.

691
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:29,445
How are ya?

692
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,130
Yeah. Let's get started.

693
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:37,507
Yeah, let's do it. I'm pumped.

694
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,309
Let's let the healing begin.

695
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,001
Will you excuse us?

696
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:42,409
Yeah, please, Tom.

697
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,553
You, too, Gerry.

698
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,132
Yeah, of course.

699
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:53,442
How are you?

700
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:57,789
Where you from in Southie?

701
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,134
I like what you've
done with the place.

702
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:01,354
Oh, thanks.

703
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:04,170
Do you buy all
these books retail,

704
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,083
or do you send away for,
like, a 'shrink kit'

705
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:08,152
that comes with all
these volumes included?

706
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:09,401
Do you like books?

707
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:11,267
Yeah.

708
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:14,017
-Did you read any of these books?
-I don't know.

709
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,908
How about any of these books?

710
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:17,255
Probably not.

711
00:38:17,316 --> 00:38:19,241
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

712
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:22,885
-Yeah, I read those.
-Good for you.

713
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:24,747
What do you think about 'em?

714
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:26,658
I'm not here for a
fuckin' book report.

715
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,946
They're your books.
Why don't you read 'em?

716
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:29,586
I did. I had to.

717
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,795
Must've taken you a long time.

718
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:33,065
Yeah, it did.

719
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,533
United States of America:
A Complete History,

720
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,193
Volume I.

721
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,259
Jesus.

722
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:58,846
If you wanna read a
real history book,

723
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:01,080
read Howard Zinn's A People's
History in the United States.

724
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,908
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

725
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,986
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

726
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,026
Do you think that's a good book?

727
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,776
You fuckin' people baffle me.

728
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:12,041
You spend all your money on
these fuckin' fancy books.

729
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,315
You surround
yourselves with 'em.

730
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:14,562
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

731
00:39:14,623 --> 00:39:16,336
What are the right
fuckin' books, Will?

732
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:18,705
Whatever blows your hair back.

733
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:20,845
Yeah. Haven't got
much hair left.

734
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,396
Hey, you know you'd be
better shoving that cigarette

735
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:24,994
up your ass. It'd probably
be healthier for you.

736
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:27,526
Yeah, I know. It really
gets in the way of my yoga.

737
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:29,911
-You work out, huh?

738
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,268
What, you lift?

739
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:32,324
Yeah.

740
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:33,648
Nautilus?

741
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:34,673
No, free weights.

742
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:37,488
-Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah, big time.

743
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,630
-Yeah?
-Just like that.

744
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:40,964
-What do you bench?
-285. What do you bench?

745
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:44,002
You paint that?

746
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:46,768
-Yeah.
-Do you paint?

747
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:48,455
Do you sculpt?

748
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:50,200
No.

749
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,202
Do you like art?

750
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:53,790
Do you like music?

751
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,847
This is a real piece of shit.

752
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,515
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

753
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:00,496
I don't know. Just the...

754
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,149
linear and impressionistic mix

755
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,150
makes a very
muddled composition.

756
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:06,991
It's also a Winslow
Homer rip-off,

757
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:09,250
except you got whitey
rowin' the boat there.

758
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:11,380
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

759
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,874
That's not really what
concerns me though.

760
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,015
What concerns you?

761
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,147
-Just the colouring.
-You know what the real bitch of it is?

762
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,700
It's paint-by-number.

763
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:19,921
Is it colour-by-number?

764
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,243
Because the colours
are fascinating to me.

765
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:22,752
-Aren't they really?
-You bet.

766
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,348
I think you're
about one step away

767
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,670
from cuttin' your
fuckin' ear off.

768
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:26,680
Really?

769
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,861
Oh, yeah.

770
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:29,856
Think I should move to
the south of France,

771
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,097
change my name to 'Vincent'?

772
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:34,058
You ever heard the sayin',
'any port in a storm'?

773
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:34,791
Yeah.

774
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:36,882
Yeah, maybe that means you.

775
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,149
In what way?

776
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,380
Maybe you're in the middle of
a storm, a big fuckin' storm.

777
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,380
Yeah, maybe.

778
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,520
The sky's fallin' on your head.

779
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,133
The waves are crashin'
over your little boat.

780
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,643
The oars are about to snap.

781
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:49,464
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

782
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,286
So maybe you do what
you gotta do to get out.

783
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,363
You know, maybe you
became a psychologist.

784
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,607
Bingo. That's it.

785
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:58,057
Let me do my job now. You
start with me. Come on.

786
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:01,579
Maybe you married
the wrong woman.

787
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:03,060
Maybe you should
watch your mouth!

788
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:06,906
Watch it right there,
chief, all right?

789
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,398
Ah.

790
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:17,742
That's it, isn't it?

791
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,467
You married the wrong woman.

792
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,461
What happened?

793
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:26,948
What, did she leave you?

794
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,651
Was she, you know...
banging some other guy?

795
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:34,831
If you ever disrespect my
wife again, I will end you.

796
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:36,541
I will fuckin' end you.

797
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:38,588
Got that, chief?

798
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,115
Time's up.

799
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:44,201
Yeah.

800
00:41:58,324 --> 00:41:59,563
At ease, gentlemen.

801
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,165
You okay?

802
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,123
Look, I'll understand if you
don't wanna meet with him again.

803
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:20,384
Thursday, 4:00. Make
sure the kid's here.

804
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,170
Yeah.

805
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:26,614
Thanks.

806
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:35,237
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

807
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:37,075
-Thank you very much.
-They're just beautiful.

808
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,183
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

809
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,472
Wonderful.

810
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:45,197
Growing up in England, you know,

811
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,541
I went to a very nice school.

812
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:48,332
You know, it was kind of...

813
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,138
progressive, organic,

814
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,619
do-it-yourself, private school.

815
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:53,908
Then Harvard.

816
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,091
Hopefully med school.

817
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,384
You know, I figured
out, by the end,

818
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:02,091
my brain's gonna
be worth $250,000.

819
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:04,960
That sounded
horrible, didn't it?

820
00:44:07,755 --> 00:44:10,128
Bring me another mai tai!

821
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:11,523
Yeah, that's cool.

822
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:13,457
I mean, I bet your
parents were happy to pay.

823
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:16,320
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

824
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,650
Wow.

825
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,241
Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

826
00:44:21,488 --> 00:44:24,219
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

827
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:26,529
All right, so you
just wanted to use

828
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,594
this sailor and
then run away, huh?

829
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:30,143
Well, I was gonna, you know,

830
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,874
experiment on you for anatomy
class first, obviously.

831
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:34,191
In that case, that's fine.

832
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,408
Hey, you wanna see my
magic tricks, Skylar?

833
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,089
Of course.

834
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,042
All right.

835
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:40,760
Promise to...

836
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,191
All right.

837
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:45,331
This one's for you, Rudolph.

838
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:47,282
Wait, wait. You need my wand.

839
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:48,685
All right, give me a hit.

840
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:50,334
Thank you. All right.

841
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:52,188
I'm gonna make all these
caramels disappear.

842
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,428
You ready?

843
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:54,915
Ready.

844
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,145
One,

845
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:57,174
two,

846
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:58,239
three.

847
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,278
They're all gone.

848
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,542
That was my... It works
better when I have my rabbit.

849
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:04,739
Well...

850
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,118
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

851
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,489
How very unfortunate...

852
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:12,238
I think for me.

853
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,584
You know what I mean?

854
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,548
I know you've been
thinking about it.

855
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:19,263
-Oh, no, I haven't.
-Yes, you have.

856
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:21,110
No, I really haven't.

857
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:22,657
Yes, you have. You're hoping
to get good night kiss.

858
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:23,828
No, you know, I tell ya,

859
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:25,592
I was hopin' to get
a good night laid.

860
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,595
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

861
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:33,273
-How very noble of you.
-Thank you.

862
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,333
No, I was... I was
hopin' for a kiss.

863
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:40,970
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

864
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:44,153
-Right now?
-Yeah.

865
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:46,383
Come on.

866
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,894
I think I got some
of your pickle.

867
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:11,072
You again, huh?

868
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,336
Come with me.

869
00:46:22,173 --> 00:46:23,304
So what's this?

870
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:25,884
A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

871
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:28,847
This is really nice.

872
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,630
You got a thing for swans?
Is this, like, a fetish?

873
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:32,504
Is it something, like,

874
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:34,313
maybe we need to
devote some time to?

875
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,890
Thought about what you
said to me the other day.

876
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,671
About my painting.

877
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:43,375
Stayed up half the
night thinking about it.

878
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:46,798
Something occurred to me.

879
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,657
I fell into a deep,
peaceful sleep

880
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,529
and haven't thought
about you since.

881
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,563
You know what occurred to me?

882
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:54,687
No.

883
00:46:55,623 --> 00:46:56,453
You're just a kid.

884
00:46:57,694 --> 00:46:59,911
You don't have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

885
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:00,756
Why, thank you.

886
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:01,708
It's all right.

887
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:04,715
You've never been out of Boston.

888
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:08,723
Nope.

889
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:11,015
So if I asked you about art,

890
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:12,100
you'd probably
give me the skinny

891
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,500
on every art book ever written.

892
00:47:14,924 --> 00:47:15,894
Michelangelo?

893
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:18,375
You know a lot about him.

894
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:19,782
Life's work,

895
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:22,185
political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

896
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:24,475
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

897
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,264
I bet you can't tell me

898
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:30,103
what it smells like
in the Sistine Chapel.

899
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:34,865
You never actually stood there

900
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:36,771
and looked up at that
beautiful ceiling.

901
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:41,191
Seeing that.

902
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:44,611
If I ask you about women,

903
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:47,429
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

904
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:50,677
You may have even
been laid a few times.

905
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:58,738
But you can't tell
me what it feels like

906
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,697
to wake up next to a woman,
and feel truly happy.

907
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,743
You're a tough kid.

908
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,366
I ask you about
war, you'd probably

909
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,241
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

910
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,436
'Once more into the
breach, dear friends.'

911
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:19,524
But you've never been near one.

912
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:23,323
You've never held your best
friend's head in your lap...

913
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,154
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

914
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,614
If I asked you about love,

915
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:33,492
you'd probably
quote me a sonnet,

916
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:36,927
but you've never
looked at a woman

917
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:38,350
and been totally vulnerable.

918
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:42,083
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

919
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:47,150
Feelin' like God put an
angel on earth just for you,

920
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:50,832
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

921
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:53,802
And you wouldn't know what
it's like to be her angel,

922
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,505
to have that love for
her be there forever.

923
00:48:58,455 --> 00:48:59,302
Through anything.

924
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:01,071
Through cancer.

925
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,214
And you wouldn't
know about sleepin'

926
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,320
sittin' up in a hospital room...

927
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:06,983
for two months,
holding her hand,

928
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:09,178
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

929
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:11,429
that the terms 'visiting
hours' don't apply to you.

930
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:15,294
You don't know about real loss,

931
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,946
'cause that only
occurs when you love

932
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:19,636
something more than
you love yourself.

933
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,862
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

934
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,546
I look at you.

935
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,688
I don't see an
intelligent, confident man.

936
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:37,775
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

937
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,427
But you're a genius, Will.

938
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,602
No one denies that.

939
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,869
No one could possibly
understand the depths of you.

940
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:48,674
But you presume
to know everything

941
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,204
about me because you
saw a painting of mine.

942
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:52,296
You ripped my
fuckin' life apart.

943
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:57,974
You're an orphan, right?

944
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:05,173
Do you think I'd
know the first thing

945
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:06,850
about how hard your
life has been...

946
00:50:07,076 --> 00:50:09,021
how you feel, who you are...

947
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,811
because I read Oliver Twist?

948
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,689
Does that encapsulate you?

949
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:18,451
Personally,

950
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:21,448
I don't give a shit about all
that, because... you know what?

951
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:23,032
I can't learn
anything from you...

952
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:24,925
I can't read in
some fuckin' book.

953
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:28,826
Unless you wanna talk about you,

954
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:30,445
who you are.

955
00:50:32,937 --> 00:50:34,243
And I'm fascinated.

956
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:36,207
I'm in.

957
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,541
But you don't wanna do
that, do you, sport?

958
00:50:44,614 --> 00:50:46,367
You're terrified of
what you might say.

959
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:53,505
Your move, chief.

960
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:02,441
Hello?

961
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,079
Hello?

962
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:06,386
Hello?

963
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,731
Professor Valenti, are
you calling me again?

964
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:14,840
Freak.

965
00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:21,296
-Oh, God.
-Christ, who did you call?

966
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,131
No one. I forgot the number.

967
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,229
You fuckin' retarded?

968
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,423
You went all the way
out there in the rain,

969
00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:26,521
and you didn't bring the number.

970
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,414
No, it was your
mother's 900 number.

971
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:29,751
I just ran out of quarters.

972
00:52:30,193 --> 00:52:32,588
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

973
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,589
That's pretty funny, Morgan.

974
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,699
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch.

975
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,567
Keep antagonizing me.
Watch what happens.

976
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:40,309
All right, then, Morgan.

977
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:42,190
-Watch what happens.
-All right, then, Morgan.

978
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,118
Watch what happens.
Keep fuckin' with me.

979
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:51,324
No smoking.

980
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,728
What do you mean,
he didn't talk?

981
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:26,920
You were in there for an hour.

982
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:28,548
He just sat there
counting the seconds

983
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:29,960
until the session was over.

984
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:31,643
Pretty impressive, actually.

985
00:53:31,704 --> 00:53:32,885
Why would he do that?

986
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:34,788
To prove to me he doesn't
have to talk to me

987
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:35,738
if he doesn't want to.

988
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:39,235
What is this? Some
kind of staring contest

989
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:41,047
between two kids from
the old neighbourhood?

990
00:53:41,277 --> 00:53:42,061
Yeah, it is,

991
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:44,278
and I can't talk first.

992
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,003
We know your theory, Alexander,

993
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,262
but the boy's found a
simple geometrical picture.

994
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,474
A tree structure won't work.

995
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:53,138
Look now. He's joining
the two vertices.

996
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,993
But I can do the sum.

997
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:57,777
It's how you group
the terms, Alexander.

998
00:53:57,844 --> 00:54:00,182
But, Gerry, if we do the
whole thing this way, then...

999
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:01,665
Hey, look, look.

1000
00:54:03,498 --> 00:54:04,391
I wrote it down.

1001
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:06,022
It's simpler this way.

1002
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,803
Sometimes people get lucky.

1003
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:21,850
You're a brilliant man.

1004
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,898
You know, I was on
this plane once,

1005
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,560
and I'm sittin' there, and...

1006
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,843
the captain gets on, he
does his whole, you know,

1007
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,810
'we'll be cruisin'
at 35,000 feet',

1008
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:11,012
but then he puts the mike down.
He forgets to turn it off.

1009
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,120
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like, 'You know,

1010
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,796
all I could use right
now is a fuckin'

1011
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:18,543
blow job and a cup of coffee.'

1012
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,789
So the stewardess
fuckin' goes bombin'

1013
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:21,755
up from the back of the plane...

1014
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,506
to tell him the
microphone's still on.

1015
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:24,549
This guy in the back
of the plane's like,

1016
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,323
'Hey, hon, don't
forget the coffee'.

1017
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:30,036
You ever been on a plane?

1018
00:55:30,754 --> 00:55:32,053
No, but it's a fuckin' joke.

1019
00:55:32,114 --> 00:55:33,706
It works better if I tell
it in the first person.

1020
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:34,553
Yeah, it does.

1021
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:40,609
I have been laid, you know?

1022
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:41,814
Really?

1023
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:43,483
Good for you.

1024
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:44,165
Big time.

1025
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:45,449
Big time, huh?

1026
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:48,227
I went on a date last week.

1027
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:49,833
-How'd it go?
-It was good.

1028
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:52,498
Goin' out again?

1029
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:53,497
I don't know.

1030
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,049
Why not?

1031
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:55,060
Haven't called her.

1032
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:56,649
Christ, you're an amateur.

1033
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,650
-I know what I'm doin'.
-Oh, yeah?

1034
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,244
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

1035
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,475
Yeah, but this girl was,
like, you know, beautiful.

1036
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:06,982
She's smart. She's fun.

1037
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:10,190
She's different from most
of the girls I've been with.

1038
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:11,911
So call her up, Romeo.

1039
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:13,755
Why, so I can realize
she's not that smart.

1040
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:15,877
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

1041
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,341
This girl's, like,
fuckin' perfect right now.

1042
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:19,734
I don't wanna ruin that.

1043
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,050
Maybe you're perfect right now.

1044
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,340
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

1045
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:27,619
But I think that's a
super philosophy, Will.

1046
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:29,312
That way, you can go
through your entire life

1047
00:56:29,373 --> 00:56:31,062
without ever having to
really know anybody.

1048
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:37,797
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

1049
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,465
She had all sorts of
wonderful idiosyncrasies.

1050
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,617
You know, she used
to fart in her sleep.

1051
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,515
Just thought I'd
share that with you.

1052
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:49,350
One night it was so
loud, it woke the dog up.

1053
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:55,129
She woke up and gone,
like, 'Was that you?'

1054
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,565
I said, 'Yeah'. I didn't
have the heart to tell her.

1055
00:56:57,025 --> 00:56:58,153
Oh, God.

1056
00:56:58,236 --> 00:57:00,488
-She woke herself up?
-Yes.

1057
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:07,249
Oh, Christ.

1058
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,643
But, Will, she's
been dead two years

1059
00:57:09,707 --> 00:57:10,865
and that's the shit I remember.

1060
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:12,881
It's wonderful stuff, you know?

1061
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:14,044
Little things like that.

1062
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:17,013
Yeah, but those are the
things I miss the most.

1063
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:20,917
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

1064
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:23,167
That's what made her my wife.

1065
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:25,612
Boy, and she had
the goods on me too.

1066
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:27,689
She knew all my
little peccadilloes.

1067
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:30,395
People call these
things 'imperfections',

1068
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:33,132
but they're not.
That's the good stuff.

1069
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:35,747
And then we get to choose

1070
00:57:35,808 --> 00:57:37,804
who we let into our
weird little worlds.

1071
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,369
You're not perfect, sport.

1072
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:43,890
And let me save
you the suspense.

1073
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,293
This girl you met,

1074
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,044
she isn't perfect either.

1075
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:49,129
But the question
is whether or not

1076
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,352
you're perfect for each other.

1077
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:52,505
That's the whole deal.

1078
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,124
That's what intimacy
is all about.

1079
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,718
Now you can know everything
in the world, sport,

1080
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,323
but the only way you're
findin' out that one

1081
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:00,410
is by givin' it a shot.

1082
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:03,233
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

1083
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:06,376
Even if I did know, I wouldn't
tell a pissant like you.

1084
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:09,439
Yeah, why not?

1085
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:12,776
You told me every other fuckin' thing.
Jesus Christ.

1086
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:16,114
Fuckin' talk more than any
shrink I ever seen in my life.

1087
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:18,301
I teach the shit. I didn't
say I knew how to do it.

1088
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:20,807
Yeah.

1089
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:28,386
You ever think about
gettin' remarried?

1090
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:29,529
My wife's dead.

1091
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,605
Hence the word 'remarried'.

1092
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:33,671
She's dead.

1093
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:39,882
Yeah, well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

1094
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:41,088
I mean, that way,
you can actually

1095
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:42,128
go through the rest
of your life...

1096
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,757
without ever really
knowing anybody.

1097
00:58:47,353 --> 00:58:48,071
Time's up.

1098
00:59:03,768 --> 00:59:05,323
-Hold it open.
-Okay.

1099
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,557
Thanks.

1100
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,289
'G' minor seventh,
saddest of all chords.

1101
00:59:42,353 --> 00:59:43,239
-Hello.
-Hey.

1102
00:59:44,273 --> 00:59:45,057
Where have you been?

1103
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:46,882
I'm sorry. I've been,

1104
00:59:47,256 --> 00:59:48,482
like... really busy, and...

1105
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:50,670
-But, um...
-Me too.

1106
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:52,078
Yeah.

1107
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:53,528
I...

1108
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:55,567
I thought you'd call.

1109
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:58,209
Yeah, um...

1110
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,448
I mean, we had a
really good time.

1111
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,427
I had a really good time too.
I mean, I just... I...

1112
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,037
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.

1113
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,889
No. No, I mean, you
know, it's all right.

1114
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,082
Yeah, um, so, I was...

1115
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,627
wonderin' if, uh,

1116
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,265
if, you know, you'd give
me another crack at it.

1117
01:00:13,326 --> 01:00:14,752
You know, let me
take you out again.

1118
01:00:15,617 --> 01:00:16,777
I can't.

1119
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:18,416
All right.

1120
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:19,318
Oh, no, I didn't...

1121
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:21,551
I didn't mean I
can't, like, ever.

1122
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:23,692
I just can't right now.

1123
01:00:23,946 --> 01:00:27,145
I've got to assign the proton
spectrum for 'ebogamine'.

1124
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,100
All that sounds really,
really interesting.

1125
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:31,119
It's actually
fantastically boring.

1126
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:33,929
-All right, um...
-Maybe some other time.

1127
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,867
Like tomorrow?

1128
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,391
Um, yeah, all right.

1129
01:00:37,774 --> 01:00:38,700
-Okay.
-Okay.

1130
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:40,667
-Bye.
-Bye.

1131
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:57,645
What are you doing here?

1132
01:00:57,896 --> 01:00:59,224
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

1133
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:02,580
Where the fuck did you get this?

1134
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,624
I had to sleep with
someone in your class.

1135
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:06,693
Oh, I hope it was someone
with the open-toed sandals

1136
01:01:06,754 --> 01:01:08,477
and the really bad breath.

1137
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:11,903
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

1138
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:13,914
No, I've got to learn this.

1139
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,722
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

1140
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:17,801
No.

1141
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:19,331
Let's go.

1142
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:26,267
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!

1143
01:01:27,686 --> 01:01:29,359
Come on, Misty!

1144
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,681
Come on! Run! Look at that!
Come on!

1145
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,462
Look, there he goes. Misty, run!
Come on!

1146
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:38,141
We won.

1147
01:01:39,302 --> 01:01:40,453
He totally won.

1148
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:44,564
So did you grow up
around here then?

1149
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,156
Not far. South Boston.

1150
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:51,190
Still glowing from my win.

1151
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,291
Look at you. You're so happy.

1152
01:01:56,158 --> 01:01:57,204
And what was that like then?

1153
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,916
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

1154
01:02:02,491 --> 01:02:03,904
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

1155
01:02:04,484 --> 01:02:06,013
Do I have a lot of
brothers and sisters?

1156
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:06,727
That's what I said.

1157
01:02:07,776 --> 01:02:09,299
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

1158
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:11,487
Right. That's right.

1159
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,276
How many?

1160
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,606
God. You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

1161
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:21,494
Why? Go on. What? Five?

1162
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:22,813
-No.
-Seven?

1163
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:25,291
Eight? How many?

1164
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:27,490
-I have 12 big brothers.
-You do not!

1165
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:28,683
No, I swear to God.

1166
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,583
I swear to God. I'm
lucky 13 right here.

1167
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:32,411
Do you know all their names?

1168
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:35,267
Do I... yeah,
they're my brothers.

1169
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,488
What are they called?

1170
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:39,810
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

1171
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,918
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

1172
01:02:42,438 --> 01:02:43,333
Say it again.

1173
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:46,315
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

1174
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:48,629
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

1175
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:51,434
And Willy.

1176
01:02:51,495 --> 01:02:52,305
-Willy?
-Yeah.

1177
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:54,133
-Will.
-Wow.

1178
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,437
Do you still see all of them?

1179
01:02:56,617 --> 01:02:57,881
Yeah, well, they
all live in Southie.

1180
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:59,734
I'm livin' with three
of 'em right now.

1181
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:00,516
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1182
01:03:01,214 --> 01:03:02,334
I'd like to meet them.

1183
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:04,175
Yeah, we'll do that.

1184
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,157
Oh, you know, I read
your book last night.

1185
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:08,693
Oh, so you're the one.

1186
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,932
Do you still, uh... Do you
still counsel veterans?

1187
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,078
No, I don't.

1188
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:13,703
Why not?

1189
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:15,792
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

1190
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:20,536
You ever wonder what your
life would be like if you, uh,

1191
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,750
if you never met your wife?

1192
01:03:23,856 --> 01:03:26,122
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

1193
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:27,288
No, no, no, I'm not
saying, like, better off.

1194
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,910
No.

1195
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:28,780
I didn't mean it like that.

1196
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:30,212
It's all right. It's
an important question.

1197
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:33,149
'Cause you'll have bad times,

1198
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:34,406
but that'll always
wake you up...

1199
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:36,354
to the good stuff you
weren't paying attention to.

1200
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:39,279
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

1201
01:03:39,446 --> 01:03:41,114
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

1202
01:03:42,129 --> 01:03:43,449
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but,

1203
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:46,489
I don't regret a single
day I spent with her.

1204
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:54,763
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

1205
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,429
October 21, 1975.

1206
01:03:57,889 --> 01:03:59,674
Jesus Christ. You
know the fuckin' day?

1207
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,563
Oh, yeah,

1208
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:03,119
'cause it was game six
of the World Series,

1209
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,037
biggest game in Red Sox history.

1210
01:04:05,098 --> 01:04:06,111
Yeah, sure.

1211
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:09,879
My friends and I had slept
out all night to get tickets.

1212
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:11,065
You got tickets?

1213
01:04:11,419 --> 01:04:13,307
Yep. Day of the game
I was sittin' in a bar,

1214
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:14,673
waitin' for the game to start

1215
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:16,816
and in walks this girl.

1216
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,499
It was an amazing game though.

1217
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,236
You know, bottom of the
eighth, Carbo ties it up.

1218
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,113
It was 6-6.

1219
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:22,643
It went to 12.

1220
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:23,833
Bottom of the 12th,

1221
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:26,433
in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge.

1222
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,958
Steps up to the plate. You know,

1223
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:29,427
-he's got that weird stance.
-Yeah, yeah.

1224
01:04:29,488 --> 01:04:31,817
And then 'Boom'! He
clocks it, you know.

1225
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:35,071
High fly ball down
the left field line!

1226
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:37,195
Thirty-five thousand
people on their feet,

1227
01:04:37,538 --> 01:04:38,709
yellin' at the ball.
But that's nothin',

1228
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,359
'cause Fisk, he's wavin'
at the ball like a madman.

1229
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,266
-Yeah, I've seen that.
-'Get over! Get over!

1230
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:43,421
-Right.
-Get over!'

1231
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,487
Then it hits the foul pole.

1232
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:48,420
He goes ape-shit,
and 35,000 fans...

1233
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:50,269
They charge the field, you know.

1234
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,259
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

1235
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,702
'Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!'

1236
01:04:54,963 --> 01:04:57,479
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

1237
01:04:57,814 --> 01:04:58,613
Did you rush the field?

1238
01:04:58,674 --> 01:05:00,799
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

1239
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,130
What?

1240
01:05:02,259 --> 01:05:04,525
No, I was in a bar, havin'
a drink with my future wife.

1241
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:06,611
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run...
-Oh yeah.

1242
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:09,039
to have a fuckin' drink with
some lady you never met?

1243
01:05:09,123 --> 01:05:11,501
Yeah, but you should have seen her.
She was a stunner.

1244
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:13,919
-I don't care if...
-Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

1245
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:16,075
I don't care if Helen of
Troy walks into the room.

1246
01:05:16,136 --> 01:05:16,873
Oh, Helen of Troy!

1247
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:18,089
That's game six! Oh, my God,

1248
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,344
and who were these
friends of yours?

1249
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:20,720
They let you get away with that?

1250
01:05:20,781 --> 01:05:21,553
They had to.

1251
01:05:21,654 --> 01:05:23,404
What did you say to 'em?

1252
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,279
I just slid my ticket
across the table.

1253
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,771
I said, 'Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl.'

1254
01:05:29,288 --> 01:05:30,890
-'I gotta go see about a girl'?
-Yes!

1255
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:33,163
That's what you said? They
let you get away with that?

1256
01:05:33,224 --> 01:05:35,143
Oh, yeah. They saw it in
my eyes that I meant it.

1257
01:05:35,896 --> 01:05:36,597
You're kiddin' me?

1258
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:38,146
No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

1259
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,803
That's why I'm not
talkin' right now

1260
01:05:39,864 --> 01:05:41,839
about some girl I saw
at a bar 20 years ago...

1261
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,136
and how I always regretted not
goin' over and talkin' to her.

1262
01:05:44,943 --> 01:05:47,248
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

1263
01:05:47,412 --> 01:05:48,605
I don't regret the six years

1264
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:50,276
I had to give up counselling
when she got sick,

1265
01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:53,222
and I don't regret the last
years when she got really sick.

1266
01:05:54,904 --> 01:05:57,109
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

1267
01:05:58,362 --> 01:05:59,259
That's regret.

1268
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:00,955
Wow!

1269
01:06:08,323 --> 01:06:10,015
Would have been nice to
catch that game though.

1270
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:12,258
I didn't know Pudge was
gonna hit a home run.

1271
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:16,044
You know,

1272
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:20,156
I'm very, very useful on the court.
I'm extremely tall.

1273
01:06:21,806 --> 01:06:23,730
-You're not that tall.
-I dunk.

1274
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,186
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

1275
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,701
'It is decidedly so.'

1276
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:38,784
Why do we always stay here?

1277
01:06:40,117 --> 01:06:42,005
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

1278
01:06:42,317 --> 01:06:43,887
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

1279
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:46,150
I know.

1280
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,547
When am I gonna meet your
friends and your brothers?

1281
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,735
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

1282
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,282
I think I can make
it to South Boston.

1283
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,262
It's kind of a hike.

1284
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:01,870
Is it me you're hiding from
them or the other way around?

1285
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:05,338
-All right, we'll go.
-When?

1286
01:07:06,364 --> 01:07:08,605
I don't know. We'll
go sometime next week.

1287
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,145
What if I said I would
not sleep with you again

1288
01:07:12,206 --> 01:07:14,134
until you let me
meet your friends?

1289
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,492
I'd say it's, like,
4:30 in the mornin'.

1290
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:22,442
They're probably up.

1291
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:24,100
Oh, my God.

1292
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:26,098
Men are shameless.

1293
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:28,024
If you're not thinking
with your wiener,

1294
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,846
then you're acting
directly on its behalf.

1295
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:32,479
You bet. And on
behalf of my wiener,

1296
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:34,378
can I get an advance payment?

1297
01:07:34,439 --> 01:07:35,125
I don't know. Let's ask.

1298
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:39,208
'Outlook does not look good.'

1299
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:39,864
What?

1300
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:42,345
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No.
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

1301
01:07:42,736 --> 01:07:44,513
'Outlook'? That's the same thing

1302
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:45,866
that told you you was
gonna play in the N.B.A.

1303
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:47,296
Well, exactly, so look out.

1304
01:07:47,357 --> 01:07:48,933
You'd better start buying
some season tickets.

1305
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,954
I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

1306
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:57,266
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

1307
01:07:57,408 --> 01:07:59,697
-You're not that tall.
-Yes, I am.

1308
01:08:00,228 --> 01:08:02,605
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

1309
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:04,745
I'm all about home runs.

1310
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:09,488
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

1311
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,759
A leprechaun's got his
dick in the monkey's ass.

1312
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,555
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',

1313
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,557
'I don't mind it. I don't mind.'

1314
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:33,127
Well, I can't believe
you brought Skylar here

1315
01:08:33,188 --> 01:08:34,756
when we're fuckin' all
bombed and drinkin'.

1316
01:08:34,817 --> 01:08:37,136
I know, Morgan. It's a real
rarity we'd be all drinkin'.

1317
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,528
My uncle Marty drinks.

1318
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:41,560
He'll go on a bender
for six, eight months.

1319
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,733
Did I ever tell ya
what happened to him

1320
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,116
when he was drivin' up
there and got pulled over?

1321
01:08:44,177 --> 01:08:45,737
-I told you guys, right?
-Marty, yeah.

1322
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:47,651
Let me tell ya what
happened to my uncle Marty,

1323
01:08:47,712 --> 01:08:49,445
because you oughta know this.

1324
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:51,258
He's always tellin' stories.

1325
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:53,286
Every time we come here
he's got another story.

1326
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,947
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

1327
01:08:57,575 --> 01:08:59,368
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.

1328
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,384
Guess I have the floor now.

1329
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:04,776
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

1330
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:07,180
Bombed out of his tree, right?

1331
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:10,081
Just hammered out of his gourd.
Just wrecked.

1332
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:12,945
This state trooper sees
him, pulls him over.

1333
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:14,436
So my uncle's fucked basically.

1334
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:16,441
Got him out of the car, tryin'
to make him walk the line.

1335
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:17,394
He gets out of the car,

1336
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:20,399
pukes, and the statie's pretty
sure he's over the legal limit.

1337
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:24,445
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

1338
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,233
All of a sudden, 50
yards down the road,

1339
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,346
there's this huge
fuckin' boom, right?

1340
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,197
Statie gets real spooked.

1341
01:09:30,258 --> 01:09:31,998
-He turns around.
-He got shot?

1342
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:35,102
No. So... So... You
heard this story before.

1343
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:37,136
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

1344
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:39,259
Some other guy's
car had hit a tree.

1345
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,880
Okay. There was an accident.

1346
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:42,983
Anyway...

1347
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:45,050
-How could he hear...
-Shut the fuck up!

1348
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:46,750
You're drivin' him nuts, Morgan.

1349
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:48,277
I'm gonna break your neck.
Shut up!

1350
01:09:48,338 --> 01:09:49,890
He told you the
story once before.

1351
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:52,387
So he tells my uncle, 'Stay here.
Don't move.'

1352
01:09:52,585 --> 01:09:53,808
Statie goes runnin' down the

1353
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:56,072
road to deal with
the other accident.

1354
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,406
After a few minutes of just

1355
01:09:58,467 --> 01:10:00,434
lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

1356
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,034
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

1357
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:05,170
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

1358
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:08,310
The next mornin' my
uncle's just passed out.

1359
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:10,640
He hears this
knockin' at the door.

1360
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:11,941
So he goes downstairs,

1361
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:13,322
pulls the door open 'What?'

1362
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:15,496
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

1363
01:10:15,993 --> 01:10:17,579
Statie says, 'Fuck
you mean, 'What?'

1364
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:18,652
You know what.

1365
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:21,535
I pulled you over last night
is what, and you took off.'

1366
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,101
He's like, 'I never seen
you before in my life.

1367
01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:25,641
I've been home all
night with my kids.

1368
01:10:25,702 --> 01:10:27,001
I don't know who
the fuck you are.'

1369
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:28,456
He's like, 'You know who I am.

1370
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:29,838
Let me get in your garage.'

1371
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:31,303
My uncle's like,

1372
01:10:31,414 --> 01:10:32,603
'What?' He said, 'You heard me.
Let me get in your garage.'

1373
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,807
He was like, 'All right. Fine.'

1374
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,717
Takes him out to the
garage, opens the door.

1375
01:10:35,838 --> 01:10:37,232
And there's...

1376
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:40,976
the statie's police cruiser
is in my uncle's garage.

1377
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,176
He was so fuckin'...

1378
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,943
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

1379
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:49,546
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

1380
01:10:49,658 --> 01:10:51,894
was so embarrassed he
didn't do anything.

1381
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,643
He'd been drivin' around all
night in my uncle's Chevelle,

1382
01:10:54,704 --> 01:10:55,462
lookin' for the house.

1383
01:10:55,758 --> 01:10:58,800
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

1384
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,844
He got away. That's the point.

1385
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,786
-Well, question...
-Come on. Stop.

1386
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:08,146
-I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
-You're embarrassing him.

1387
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,837
-It doesn't make any sense.
-It does make sense,

1388
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:12,995
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

1389
01:11:13,075 --> 01:11:14,595
Well, let's see if
you can get this one.

1390
01:11:14,656 --> 01:11:15,844
I've got a little story for you.

1391
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:17,098
All right.

1392
01:11:17,631 --> 01:11:19,111
There's an old couple in bed,

1393
01:11:19,897 --> 01:11:21,119
Mary and Paddie.

1394
01:11:21,772 --> 01:11:23,894
They wake up on the
morning of their

1395
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:25,891
50th anniversary.

1396
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:29,292
Mary looks over and gazes
adoringly at Paddie.

1397
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:31,397
She's like, 'Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

1398
01:11:31,923 --> 01:11:34,087
You're such a good-looking feller.
I love ya.

1399
01:11:34,716 --> 01:11:36,267
I want to give ya
a little present.

1400
01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:39,552
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1401
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:41,270
What would ya like?

1402
01:11:41,638 --> 01:11:42,398
Paddie's like,

1403
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:46,310
'Oh, gee, Mary. That's
a very sweet offer.

1404
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:48,697
Now, in 50 years,

1405
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:50,764
there's one thing
that's been missing,

1406
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:52,632
and, uh,

1407
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:55,417
I would like you to
give me a blow job.

1408
01:11:56,056 --> 01:11:58,907
I would like for it.'
Mary's like, 'All right.'

1409
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,106
She takes her teeth out,

1410
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:01,559
puts 'em in the glass.

1411
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:03,411
She gives him a blow job.

1412
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,774
Afterwards, Paddie's like,

1413
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:07,416
'Yeah, geez, now that's
what I've been missin'.

1414
01:12:07,552 --> 01:12:11,420
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

1415
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:13,080
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

1416
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:16,017
Is there anything that
I can do for you?'

1417
01:12:17,035 --> 01:12:18,891
Mary looks up to
him and she goes,

1418
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:21,515
'Give us a kiss.'

1419
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,892
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

1420
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,110
-That's filthy.
-It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

1421
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:33,214
Get off of me!

1422
01:12:34,093 --> 01:12:35,559
All right. See you guys later.

1423
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:37,313
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1424
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,620
So, Skylar, thanks
for comin' by.

1425
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:43,664
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

1426
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:45,603
You don't want to rush
to judgement on that one,

1427
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:46,952
'cause they're not all like me.

1428
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:50,005
Oh. I'm sure. It
was nice to meet ya.

1429
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:50,956
Oh.

1430
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:52,201
Take it easy.

1431
01:12:52,986 --> 01:12:54,200
-Oh, come on.
-Slowly back away.

1432
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,929
-Brother.
-I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1433
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:58,094
You're givin' us a ride.

1434
01:12:59,138 --> 01:13:00,218
What the fuck do I
look like to you?

1435
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:01,044
Come on, Chuck.

1436
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:03,575
You're walkin', bitch.
Will's takin' the car.

1437
01:13:04,309 --> 01:13:06,117
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1438
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:09,750
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

1439
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,052
You're droppin' me off first.

1440
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:12,868
It's really out of the way.

1441
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:15,184
Oh, okay. Just
'cause you don't have

1442
01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:16,887
to sleep in your one-room
palace tonight...

1443
01:13:16,948 --> 01:13:18,369
don't start thinkin' you're bad.

1444
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:20,447
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1445
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,917
-Not tonight.
-Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1446
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,718
He knows once you
see that shit-hole

1447
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:27,201
he's gettin' dropped
like a bad habit.

1448
01:13:27,854 --> 01:13:29,225
But I wanted to
meet your brothers.

1449
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:31,274
We're gonna do
that another time.

1450
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:32,929
All right.

1451
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:37,059
Need them keys.

1452
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,207
The stewardess hears this

1453
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:42,113
and goes haulin'
ass down the aisle.

1454
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:43,448
I yell,

1455
01:13:43,804 --> 01:13:45,127
'Don't forget the coffee.'

1456
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:46,908
No shit!

1457
01:13:47,134 --> 01:13:48,225
You didn't say that.

1458
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:50,969
For Christ's sake,
Marty, it's a joke.

1459
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:52,349
I know someone that
actually happened to, Marty.

1460
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,774
-A joke.
-Gerry.

1461
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:55,041
Hi. Have trouble
findin' the place?

1462
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,097
No, I took a cab.

1463
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:57,997
Timmy, this is Gerry.

1464
01:13:58,474 --> 01:13:59,545
We went to college together.

1465
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:01,626
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

1466
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:04,215
-Pleased to meet you.
-Can I get you a beer?

1467
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,555
Um, no, just a Perrier.

1468
01:14:07,215 --> 01:14:08,486
That's French for club soda.

1469
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,035
Club soda, yeah.

1470
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:12,538
Couple of sandwiches too.

1471
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:13,805
-Sure.
-Put it on my tab.

1472
01:14:14,092 --> 01:14:15,845
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

1473
01:14:16,357 --> 01:14:18,855
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1474
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:20,441
-What's the jackpot?
-Twelve million.

1475
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:21,579
I don't think that'll cover it.

1476
01:14:21,642 --> 01:14:23,661
It'll cover your sex
change operation.

1477
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,959
Nuts?

1478
01:14:29,484 --> 01:14:30,571
No, thank you.

1479
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:37,407
So, you wanted to
talk about Will.

1480
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:40,435
-Well, it seems to be going well.
-I think so.

1481
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,319
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1482
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:47,826
No, we haven't
gotten into that yet.

1483
01:14:47,887 --> 01:14:49,179
We're still bangin'
away at the past.

1484
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:50,842
Maybe you should.

1485
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:53,348
My phone's been ringing off
the hook with job offers.

1486
01:14:53,482 --> 01:14:54,192
What kind?

1487
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:56,650
Cutting edge mathematics,

1488
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,147
think tanks. The kind
of place where a mind

1489
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,456
like Will's is given free rein.

1490
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,898
That's great that
there are offers,

1491
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,693
but I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1492
01:15:10,293 --> 01:15:12,124
I'm not sure you
understand, Sean.

1493
01:15:13,894 --> 01:15:15,685
-What don't I understand?
-Here you go, guys.

1494
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:18,474
-Thanks, Tim.
-Yeah, thank you.

1495
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,893
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

1496
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:24,024
Tim, can you help us?

1497
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,451
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1498
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:27,400
Uh-oh.

1499
01:15:27,582 --> 01:15:29,016
Ever heard of Jonas Salk?

1500
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:31,184
Sure. Cured polio.

1501
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:32,692
Ever heard of Albert Einstein?

1502
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:34,289
Hey.

1503
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,258
How about Gerald Lambeau?

1504
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:39,332
Ever heard of him?

1505
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:41,148
-No.

1506
01:15:41,558 --> 01:15:42,594
Thank you, Tim.

1507
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,080
-So who won the bet?
-I did.

1508
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,948
This isn't about me, Sean.

1509
01:15:52,558 --> 01:15:54,346
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

1510
01:15:58,314 --> 01:16:00,117
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1511
01:16:00,507 --> 01:16:02,882
In 1905 there were
hundreds of professors

1512
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,895
renown for their
study of the universe.

1513
01:16:04,956 --> 01:16:09,000
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

1514
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:11,980
doing physics in his spare
time, who changed the world.

1515
01:16:12,257 --> 01:16:13,943
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1516
01:16:14,004 --> 01:16:16,454
just to get drunk with his
buddies in Vienna every night.

1517
01:16:17,246 --> 01:16:18,565
We all would have
lost something.

1518
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:21,525
Tim would never
have heard of him.

1519
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:23,169
Pretty dramatic, Gerry.

1520
01:16:23,499 --> 01:16:24,431
No, it isn't, Sean.

1521
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,474
This boy has that gift.

1522
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:28,829
He just doesn't
got the direction,

1523
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:29,852
but we can give that to him.

1524
01:16:30,392 --> 01:16:30,949
Hey, Gerry,

1525
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:33,557
in the 1960s, there
was a young man

1526
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:35,378
graduated from
University of Michigan.

1527
01:16:36,005 --> 01:16:38,541
Did some brilliant
work in mathematics.

1528
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:40,856
Specifically, bounded
harmonic functions.

1529
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:42,197
Then he went on to Berkeley.

1530
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,019
He was assistant professor.
Showed amazing potential.

1531
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,001
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1532
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:48,466
Yeah, so who was he?

1533
01:16:49,086 --> 01:16:49,991
Ted Kaczynski.

1534
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:51,909
Haven't heard of him.

1535
01:16:52,098 --> 01:16:52,848
Hey, Timmy!

1536
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:53,749
Yo!

1537
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:55,209
Who's Ted Kaczynski?

1538
01:16:55,672 --> 01:16:56,558
Unabomber.

1539
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:01,609
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

1540
01:17:01,957 --> 01:17:03,774
-We gotta give this kid direction.
-Yeah...

1541
01:17:03,839 --> 01:17:05,181
He can contribute to the world,

1542
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,406
and we can help him do that.

1543
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:08,344
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1544
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,307
-Sean!
-We have to let him find...

1545
01:17:10,368 --> 01:17:12,053
I'm not sitting at
home every night

1546
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:13,789
twisting my moustache
and hatching a...

1547
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:15,687
hatching a plan to
ruin this boy's life!

1548
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:17,702
I was doing advanced mathematics

1549
01:17:18,429 --> 01:17:20,547
when I was 18, and it
still took me over 20 years

1550
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:21,853
to do something worthy
of a Field's medal.

1551
01:17:21,914 --> 01:17:23,720
Maybe he doesn't
want what you want.

1552
01:17:24,234 --> 01:17:26,448
There's more to life than
a fuckin' Field's medal.

1553
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:28,249
This is too important, Sean,

1554
01:17:28,972 --> 01:17:30,452
and it's above personal rivalry.

1555
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:31,968
Wait a minute. Wait
a minute, Gerry.

1556
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:33,070
Let's talk about the boy.

1557
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:35,750
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1558
01:17:35,946 --> 01:17:37,871
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.

1559
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:39,389
It worked wonders
for you, didn't it?

1560
01:17:40,129 --> 01:17:42,206
Yeah, it did, you
arrogant fuckin' prick!

1561
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:44,529
Oh, I'm sorry.

1562
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:46,637
I'm sorry that I
came here today.

1563
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,025
I came here out of courtesy.

1564
01:17:48,092 --> 01:17:49,636
I wanted to keep
you in the loop.

1565
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:50,476
Nice to be in the loop.

1566
01:17:50,836 --> 01:17:52,209
The boy's in a meeting right now

1567
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,841
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1568
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:56,145
Well, Will,

1569
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:58,967
I'm not exactly
sure what you mean.

1570
01:17:59,445 --> 01:18:01,102
We've already offered
you a position.

1571
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:03,333
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1572
01:18:03,683 --> 01:18:05,420
You think you can find
somebody who does,

1573
01:18:05,538 --> 01:18:06,850
you have my blessin'.

1574
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,562
But I think we all
know that person

1575
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:10,454
is not gonna represent
you as well as I can.

1576
01:18:10,538 --> 01:18:13,964
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

1577
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:16,440
Retainer!

1578
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,339
Retainer.

1579
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:19,677
You want us...

1580
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,359
to give you cash right now?

1581
01:18:21,595 --> 01:18:24,651
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy...
Now, I didn't say that.

1582
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:26,674
Allegedly,

1583
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:29,320
your situation,

1584
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:30,665
for you,

1585
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:32,782
would be concurrently
improved...

1586
01:18:33,355 --> 01:18:34,599
if I had...

1587
01:18:34,948 --> 01:18:37,296
$200 in my back
pocket right now.

1588
01:18:38,954 --> 01:18:40,719
I don't think I can...

1589
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:42,413
Larry?

1590
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:45,430
I've got $73.

1591
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:47,211
Will you take a check?

1592
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,978
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1593
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:52,761
Yeah, you.

1594
01:18:54,211 --> 01:18:57,275
I don't know what your
reputation is in this town,

1595
01:18:58,449 --> 01:19:00,354
but after the shit you
tried to pull today,

1596
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:01,821
you can bet I'll be
lookin' into you.

1597
01:19:02,978 --> 01:19:03,732
Now,

1598
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:06,989
any business we have heretofore,

1599
01:19:07,946 --> 01:19:09,990
you can speak with my
aforementioned attorney.

1600
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,636
Good day, gentlemen.

1601
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:14,783
And until that day comes,

1602
01:19:15,873 --> 01:19:17,239
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1603
01:19:31,923 --> 01:19:32,757
How's it goin'?

1604
01:19:33,223 --> 01:19:33,670
Fine.

1605
01:19:33,754 --> 01:19:34,364
Yeah.

1606
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:37,035
Good.

1607
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:40,361
-Want some help?
-No!

1608
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:43,579
Come on. Give me
one little peek,

1609
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:43,989
No.

1610
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:44,888
and we'll go to
the batting cages.

1611
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:49,805
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1612
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:52,318
-It's really important...

1613
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:53,541
-All right.
-to me, okay?

1614
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,906
All right.

1615
01:19:56,979 --> 01:19:58,641
Why don't we just
hang out here all day?

1616
01:19:58,702 --> 01:19:59,665
Yes, why don't we?

1617
01:20:02,223 --> 01:20:04,407
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1618
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:08,661
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

1619
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:11,675
let me ask you a question.

1620
01:20:12,269 --> 01:20:13,143
All right.

1621
01:20:14,696 --> 01:20:16,657
Do you have a
photographic memory?

1622
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:20,281
I don't know. I just kind
of remember, you know?

1623
01:20:20,342 --> 01:20:22,288
I mean, how do you
remember your phone number?

1624
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:23,506
You just do.

1625
01:20:24,197 --> 01:20:25,881
Have you studied
organic chemistry?

1626
01:20:26,171 --> 01:20:26,997
A little bit.

1627
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:28,574
Oh, just for fun?

1628
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:29,983
Yeah, for kicks.

1629
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:33,090
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1630
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:34,358
Are you mad?

1631
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:38,057
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1632
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,141
Nobody studies it for fun.

1633
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:43,122
It's not a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1634
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:44,872
-Someone like me?
-Yeah.

1635
01:20:45,552 --> 01:20:47,190
Someone who divides their
time, fairly evenly,

1636
01:20:47,267 --> 01:20:49,379
between batting cages and bars.

1637
01:20:49,695 --> 01:20:51,792
I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1638
01:20:54,581 --> 01:20:57,180
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1639
01:20:57,263 --> 01:20:59,782
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1640
01:21:01,338 --> 01:21:02,192
And yet...

1641
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,808
you do it so easily.
I don't understand.

1642
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,132
I don't understand
how your mind works.

1643
01:21:09,193 --> 01:21:10,115
Did you play the piano?

1644
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:11,982
I want to talk about this.

1645
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:14,286
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1646
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:15,095
Yeah, a bit.

1647
01:21:15,313 --> 01:21:18,363
All right. So when you look at a
piano, you see Mozart.

1648
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,758
I see 'Chopsticks'.

1649
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:21,998
All right, well,
Beethoven, okay?

1650
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,206
He looked at a piano,

1651
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:26,057
and it just made sense to him.
He could just play.

1652
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:27,794
So what are you saying?
You play the piano?

1653
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:29,547
Not a lick. I look at a piano,

1654
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:32,174
I see a bunch of keys, three
pedals and a box of wood.

1655
01:21:33,087 --> 01:21:34,274
But Beethoven, Mozart...

1656
01:21:34,335 --> 01:21:35,934
They saw it. They
could just play.

1657
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:39,012
I couldn't paint you a picture.

1658
01:21:39,073 --> 01:21:40,966
I probably can't hit
the ball out of Fenway.

1659
01:21:41,406 --> 01:21:42,665
And I can't play the piano.

1660
01:21:43,019 --> 01:21:45,357
But you can do my O-chem
paper in under an hour.

1661
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:49,395
Right. Well, I mean, when
it came to stuff like that,

1662
01:21:49,456 --> 01:21:50,569
I could always just play.

1663
01:21:53,593 --> 01:21:55,536
That's the best
I can explain it.

1664
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:57,545
Come here.

1665
01:21:58,078 --> 01:21:59,214
I have to tell you something.

1666
01:21:59,843 --> 01:22:00,930
I have to tell you something.

1667
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:03,313
Well...

1668
01:22:19,241 --> 01:22:20,238
It's not fair.

1669
01:22:20,506 --> 01:22:22,638
What's not fair? What?

1670
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:25,726
I've been here for four years,

1671
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,654
and I've only just found you.

1672
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:31,854
Well, you found me.

1673
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:46,022
Are you awake?

1674
01:22:46,869 --> 01:22:47,646
No.

1675
01:22:50,064 --> 01:22:50,727
Yes, you are.

1676
01:22:59,736 --> 01:23:00,378
What?

1677
01:23:03,665 --> 01:23:05,671
I want you to come to
California with me.

1678
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:12,905
You sure about that?

1679
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:14,441
Oh, yeah.

1680
01:23:16,328 --> 01:23:17,488
Yeah, but how do you know?

1681
01:23:19,551 --> 01:23:20,311
I don't know.

1682
01:23:21,977 --> 01:23:22,888
I just know.

1683
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:24,980
Yeah, but how do you know?

1684
01:23:26,573 --> 01:23:28,313
I know, because...

1685
01:23:29,558 --> 01:23:30,659
I feel it.

1686
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:33,191
Because that's a really
serious thing you're saying.

1687
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:34,573
I... I know.

1688
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,316
You could be in
California next week...

1689
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,546
and you might find out something
about me you don't like.

1690
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:42,408
Maybe you wish you
hadn't said that,

1691
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,913
but you know it's such a serious
thing you can't take it back.

1692
01:23:44,974 --> 01:23:46,598
Now I'm stuck in California

1693
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:47,909
with someone that doesn't
really want to be with me,

1694
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:49,381
just wish they had a take-back.

1695
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,420
A what?

1696
01:23:50,796 --> 01:23:51,850
What's a take-back?

1697
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,397
I don't want a take-back.

1698
01:23:55,286 --> 01:23:57,351
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1699
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:01,934
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so...

1700
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:05,464
Why not?

1701
01:24:06,037 --> 01:24:07,483
Well, one, because I...

1702
01:24:07,744 --> 01:24:09,468
I got a job here.

1703
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:11,219
And, two, because I live here.

1704
01:24:12,601 --> 01:24:13,793
Look, um,

1705
01:24:15,007 --> 01:24:16,669
if you don't love me, you
should just tell me, because I...

1706
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:17,844
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1707
01:24:19,707 --> 01:24:20,620
Then why?

1708
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:22,234
Why won't you come?

1709
01:24:22,762 --> 01:24:24,575
What are you so scared of?

1710
01:24:25,349 --> 01:24:26,663
What am I so scared of?

1711
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:27,766
Well,

1712
01:24:28,269 --> 01:24:29,417
what aren't you scared of?

1713
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:33,077
You live in this safe little
world where no one challenges you,

1714
01:24:33,138 --> 01:24:34,278
and you're scared shit
just to do anything that...

1715
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:37,380
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1716
01:24:37,441 --> 01:24:38,924
I mean, you just want to have
your little fling

1717
01:24:38,985 --> 01:24:40,317
with the guy from the
other side of town.

1718
01:24:40,378 --> 01:24:41,684
Then you're gonna
go off to Stanford.

1719
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:43,325
You're gonna marry
some rich prick...

1720
01:24:43,386 --> 01:24:44,791
who your parents
will approve of...

1721
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:46,744
and just sit around with the
other trust fund babies...

1722
01:24:46,805 --> 01:24:49,003
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1723
01:24:49,326 --> 01:24:50,880
Why are you saying this?

1724
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,770
What is your obsession
with this money?

1725
01:24:55,217 --> 01:24:58,405
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1726
01:24:59,765 --> 01:25:01,228
You don't think
every day I wake up,

1727
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:03,426
and I wish I could give it back.

1728
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,568
That I would give
it back in a second

1729
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:08,758
if it meant I could have
one more day with him.

1730
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:09,696
But I can't,

1731
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:11,709
and that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1732
01:25:12,036 --> 01:25:13,773
So don't put your shit on me

1733
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:15,145
when you're the
one that's afraid.

1734
01:25:15,206 --> 01:25:16,808
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?

1735
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:18,030
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1736
01:25:18,097 --> 01:25:18,612
You're afraid of me.

1737
01:25:18,673 --> 01:25:20,091
You're afraid that I
won't love you back.

1738
01:25:20,411 --> 01:25:22,306
You know what? I'm afraid too.

1739
01:25:23,086 --> 01:25:24,458
But fuck it, I want
to give it a shot.

1740
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:26,217
At least I'm honest with you.

1741
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:27,506
I'm not honest with you?

1742
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:29,029
No, what about your 12 brothers?

1743
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:31,075
All right.

1744
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:34,234
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1745
01:25:34,472 --> 01:25:35,653
What do you want to know?

1746
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,039
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1747
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,573
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1748
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,499
-You don't want to hear that.
-I didn't know that.

1749
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,017
You don't want to hear
that I got fuckin'

1750
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:44,138
cigarettes put out on me
when I was a little kid.

1751
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:46,083
-I didn't know that.
-That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1752
01:25:46,144 --> 01:25:47,406
The mother fucker stabbed me.

1753
01:25:47,467 --> 01:25:49,458
You don't want to hear
that shit, Skylar!

1754
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,711
-I do want to hear that.
-Don't tell me you want that shit!

1755
01:25:51,788 --> 01:25:53,531
I want to hear because
I want to help you.

1756
01:25:53,599 --> 01:25:54,966
-Because I want to be...
-Help me? What the fuck?

1757
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:55,690
What do I got,

1758
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,028
a fuckin' sign on my back
that says, 'Save me'?

1759
01:25:58,089 --> 01:25:59,804
-No.
-Do I look like I need that?

1760
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:02,285
-No, I just want to be with you.
-Don't bullshit me!

1761
01:26:02,346 --> 01:26:03,077
I love you.

1762
01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:05,741
Don't bullshit me! Don't
you fuckin' bullshit me!

1763
01:26:06,798 --> 01:26:07,784
I love you.

1764
01:26:10,575 --> 01:26:13,607
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1765
01:26:14,771 --> 01:26:16,498
Because if you say that...

1766
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:19,961
then I won't call you...

1767
01:26:22,004 --> 01:26:24,293
and I won't be in your life.

1768
01:26:31,563 --> 01:26:32,384
I don't love you.

1769
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:16,809
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1770
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:19,714
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1771
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:22,097
They get convinced
they're stupid.

1772
01:27:24,433 --> 01:27:26,190
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

1773
01:27:27,495 --> 01:27:29,811
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

1774
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:31,884
not against you.

1775
01:27:37,028 --> 01:27:37,927
Hello, Will.

1776
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,347
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1777
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:42,861
Sure.

1778
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:48,956
Now, let's see.

1779
01:27:55,473 --> 01:27:56,277
Good.

1780
01:27:57,186 --> 01:27:58,513
This is correct.

1781
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,950
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1782
01:28:02,748 --> 01:28:04,518
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1783
01:28:06,838 --> 01:28:08,265
This can't be right.

1784
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:13,286
This would be very embarrassing.

1785
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:19,727
-Did you ever consider...
-I'm pretty sure it's right.

1786
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:21,002
Hey, look,

1787
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,124
can we do this at Sean's office
from now on? Because I...

1788
01:28:23,617 --> 01:28:25,391
got to knock off
work to come here

1789
01:28:25,452 --> 01:28:26,549
and the commute is killin' me.

1790
01:28:26,704 --> 01:28:27,461
-Yeah, sure.

1791
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,638
-Did you think of the possibility.
-That's right.

1792
01:28:31,571 --> 01:28:32,186
It's right.

1793
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:34,841
Just take it home with you.

1794
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,436
What happened at
the McNeil meeting?

1795
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,372
I couldn't go. I had a date.

1796
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:45,943
So I sent my chief negotiator.

1797
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:52,297
On your own time, you can
do whatever you like, Will.

1798
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:55,334
But when I set up a meeting

1799
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:56,712
with my associates,

1800
01:28:56,773 --> 01:28:58,918
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1801
01:28:59,056 --> 01:29:01,356
-Then don't set up any more meetings.
-I won't.

1802
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:02,843
I'll cancel 'em.

1803
01:29:03,946 --> 01:29:05,263
I'll give you a job myself.

1804
01:29:05,331 --> 01:29:07,136
I just wanted you to
see what was out there.

1805
01:29:07,197 --> 01:29:08,627
Maybe I don't want
to spend the rest

1806
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:11,116
of my fuckin' life
explainin' shit to people.

1807
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:20,539
I think you could show
me some appreciation.

1808
01:29:21,409 --> 01:29:22,677
A little appreciation?

1809
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:24,570
Do you know how
easy this is for me?

1810
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,293
Do you have any fuckin'
idea how easy this is?

1811
01:29:26,354 --> 01:29:27,625
This is a fuckin' joke.

1812
01:29:28,169 --> 01:29:30,118
I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am...

1813
01:29:30,202 --> 01:29:31,736
Because I wouldn't have
to fuckin' sit here

1814
01:29:31,797 --> 01:29:33,802
and watch you fumble
around and fuck it up.

1815
01:29:39,566 --> 01:29:41,210
Then you'd have more
time to sit around

1816
01:29:41,285 --> 01:29:42,757
and get drunk
instead, wouldn't you?

1817
01:29:43,009 --> 01:29:43,727
You're right.

1818
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:46,664
This is probably a
total waste of my time.

1819
01:30:01,927 --> 01:30:03,039
You're right, Will.

1820
01:30:06,113 --> 01:30:07,322
I can't do this proof,

1821
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,066
but you can. And when it comes
to that, it's only about...

1822
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,464
just a handful of
people in the world...

1823
01:30:15,525 --> 01:30:17,355
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1824
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:19,172
-But I'm one of them.
-Sorry.

1825
01:30:19,404 --> 01:30:20,512
Yeah, so am I.

1826
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:24,478
Most days I wish
I never met you,

1827
01:30:27,853 --> 01:30:29,471
because then I could
sleep at night.

1828
01:30:30,478 --> 01:30:32,823
I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge

1829
01:30:32,884 --> 01:30:34,665
that there was someone
like you out there.

1830
01:30:41,785 --> 01:30:44,445
I didn't have to watch
you throw it all away.

1831
01:30:52,167 --> 01:30:53,149
Bill, hold it.

1832
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:55,623
Did you hear that?

1833
01:30:58,009 --> 01:30:58,843
Morgan!

1834
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:02,595
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again,

1835
01:31:02,656 --> 01:31:04,120
I'm gonna give you
a fuckin' beatin'!

1836
01:31:21,276 --> 01:31:22,331
What's up, fellas?

1837
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:27,146
Morgan, why don't you jerk
off in your own fuckin' house.

1838
01:31:27,352 --> 01:31:28,707
That's fuckin' filthy.

1839
01:31:28,887 --> 01:31:30,776
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.

1840
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:34,818
Come on. Not in my glove.

1841
01:31:35,804 --> 01:31:37,754
I didn't use the glove.

1842
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:39,840
That's my Little League glove.

1843
01:31:42,592 --> 01:31:43,765
What do you want me to do?

1844
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:46,842
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1845
01:31:47,698 --> 01:31:49,637
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1846
01:31:49,857 --> 01:31:52,914
I just used it for clean-up.

1847
01:31:54,733 --> 01:31:56,826
Stop jerkin' off in
my mother's room.

1848
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,662
Is there another V.C.R.
in the house?

1849
01:31:58,829 --> 01:32:00,103
It's just sad, bro.

1850
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,499
So why do you
think I should work

1851
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,985
for the National
Security Agency?

1852
01:32:06,918 --> 01:32:09,132
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1853
01:32:10,096 --> 01:32:11,990
You'd be exposed to
the kind of technology

1854
01:32:12,051 --> 01:32:13,432
you wouldn't see anywhere else,

1855
01:32:13,493 --> 01:32:14,965
because we've classified it.

1856
01:32:16,105 --> 01:32:18,405
Super-string theory, chaos math,

1857
01:32:18,595 --> 01:32:20,409
-advanced algorithms.
-Code breaking.

1858
01:32:23,048 --> 01:32:24,768
That's one aspect of what we do.

1859
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,852
Oh, come on. That
is what you do.

1860
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:30,574
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1861
01:32:30,938 --> 01:32:33,028
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

1862
01:32:33,488 --> 01:32:35,384
We don't like to brag
about that, Will,

1863
01:32:36,704 --> 01:32:37,965
but you're exactly right.

1864
01:32:40,025 --> 01:32:41,242
So the way I see it,

1865
01:32:41,781 --> 01:32:42,762
the question isn't:

1866
01:32:43,387 --> 01:32:45,349
'Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?'

1867
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:46,918
The question is:

1868
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:48,579
'Why shouldn't you?'

1869
01:32:49,406 --> 01:32:51,156
Why shouldn't I
work for the N.S.A.?

1870
01:32:52,659 --> 01:32:53,683
That's a tough one,

1871
01:32:54,953 --> 01:32:56,190
but I'll take a shot.

1872
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,084
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.

1873
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,690
and somebody puts
a code on my desk.

1874
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:01,156
Something no one else can break.

1875
01:33:01,197 --> 01:33:03,219
Maybe I take a shot at
it and maybe I break it.

1876
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,655
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1877
01:33:05,716 --> 01:33:06,915
But maybe that code
was the location

1878
01:33:06,976 --> 01:33:09,396
of some rebel army in North
Africa or Middle East.

1879
01:33:09,457 --> 01:33:10,826
Once they have that location,

1880
01:33:10,887 --> 01:33:12,501
they bomb the village where
the rebels are hidin'.

1881
01:33:12,806 --> 01:33:14,573
Fifteen hundred people
that I never met,

1882
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:16,075
never had no problem
with, get killed.

1883
01:33:17,076 --> 01:33:18,560
Now the politicians are saying,

1884
01:33:18,621 --> 01:33:20,224
'Send in the Marines
to secure the area,'

1885
01:33:20,285 --> 01:33:21,314
'cause they don't give a shit.

1886
01:33:21,509 --> 01:33:23,211
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

1887
01:33:23,272 --> 01:33:24,911
just like it wasn't them
when their number got called

1888
01:33:24,972 --> 01:33:26,915
'cause they were in
the National Guard.

1889
01:33:27,183 --> 01:33:28,753
It'll be some kid from
Southie over there

1890
01:33:28,814 --> 01:33:29,914
takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1891
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,298
He comes back to find the
plant he used to work at...

1892
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:34,724
got exported to the
country he got back from,

1893
01:33:34,831 --> 01:33:37,135
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1894
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:39,782
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

1895
01:33:40,068 --> 01:33:41,482
Meanwhile, he realizes
the only reason

1896
01:33:41,543 --> 01:33:42,672
he was over there in
the first place...

1897
01:33:42,733 --> 01:33:44,217
was so we could
install a government

1898
01:33:44,278 --> 01:33:45,664
that would sell us
oil at a good price.

1899
01:33:45,811 --> 01:33:47,773
Of course, the oil
companies used a skirmish

1900
01:33:47,834 --> 01:33:49,632
over there to scare up
domestic oil prices.

1901
01:33:49,693 --> 01:33:51,739
A cute little ancillary
benefit for them,

1902
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,042
but it ain't helpin' my
buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1903
01:33:54,349 --> 01:33:56,504
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1904
01:33:56,565 --> 01:33:58,799
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

1905
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,119
who likes to drink Martinis

1906
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,018
and fuckin' play slalom
with the icebergs.

1907
01:34:02,165 --> 01:34:04,337
It ain't too long till he
hits one, spills the oil...

1908
01:34:04,398 --> 01:34:06,449
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1909
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:09,313
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

1910
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:11,066
so he's walkin' to the
fuckin' job interviews...

1911
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:12,785
which sucks because
the shrapnel in his ass

1912
01:34:12,846 --> 01:34:14,102
is givin' him
chronic haemorrhoids.

1913
01:34:14,163 --> 01:34:15,424
Meanwhile, he's starvin',

1914
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:16,824
'cause every time he tries
to get a bite to eat,

1915
01:34:16,885 --> 01:34:18,491
the only blue plate
special they're servin'...

1916
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:20,389
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

1917
01:34:21,759 --> 01:34:22,763
So what did I think?

1918
01:34:23,813 --> 01:34:25,422
I'm holdin' out for
somethin' better.

1919
01:34:27,405 --> 01:34:28,253
I figure, fuck it.

1920
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:30,214
While I'm at it, why
not just shoot my buddy,

1921
01:34:30,802 --> 01:34:32,675
take his job, give it
to his sworn enemy,

1922
01:34:32,736 --> 01:34:35,509
hike up gas prices, bomb a
village, club a baby seal,

1923
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,487
hit the hash pipe and
join the National Guard?

1924
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:39,517
I can be elected president.

1925
01:34:40,503 --> 01:34:41,857
You feel like
you're alone, Will?

1926
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:43,816
What?

1927
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,285
Do you have a soul mate?

1928
01:34:47,735 --> 01:34:49,375
Do I have a...? Define that.

1929
01:34:50,563 --> 01:34:52,004
Somebody who challenges you.

1930
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,549
Uh, Chuckie.

1931
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:57,479
No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie
down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1932
01:34:58,326 --> 01:35:00,792
I'm talking about someone
who opens up things for you,

1933
01:35:00,853 --> 01:35:01,920
touches your soul.

1934
01:35:04,148 --> 01:35:05,709
-I got... I got...
-Who?

1935
01:35:07,498 --> 01:35:08,438
I got plenty.

1936
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:09,612
Well, name 'em.

1937
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:13,699
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1938
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,121
That's great. They're all dead.

1939
01:35:15,827 --> 01:35:17,131
Not to me they're not.

1940
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:19,141
You don't have a lot
of dialogue with them.

1941
01:35:20,221 --> 01:35:21,853
You can't give
back to them, Will.

1942
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,811
Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.

1943
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:27,092
That's what I'm saying.

1944
01:35:28,409 --> 01:35:30,508
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1945
01:35:30,569 --> 01:35:32,655
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

1946
01:35:33,015 --> 01:35:35,664
because all you see is
every negative thing

1947
01:35:35,725 --> 01:35:36,661
ten miles down the road.

1948
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:38,446
You gonna take the
professor's side on this?

1949
01:35:38,507 --> 01:35:39,643
Don't give me a line of shit.
No.

1950
01:35:39,704 --> 01:35:40,671
I didn't want the job.

1951
01:35:40,732 --> 01:35:41,490
It's not about the job.

1952
01:35:41,551 --> 01:35:42,794
I don't care if you
work for the government.

1953
01:35:43,132 --> 01:35:44,965
But you can do
anything you want.

1954
01:35:45,026 --> 01:35:46,193
You are bound by nothing.

1955
01:35:47,713 --> 01:35:48,877
What are you passionate about?

1956
01:35:49,904 --> 01:35:50,643
What do you want?

1957
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:53,626
There are guys who work their
entire life layin' brick...

1958
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:54,898
so their kids have a chance

1959
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:56,299
at the opportunities
you have here.

1960
01:35:56,594 --> 01:35:58,253
-I didn't ask for this.
-No.

1961
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,350
You were born with it,

1962
01:35:59,437 --> 01:36:01,554
so don't cop out behind:
'I didn't ask for this.'

1963
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:02,684
-What do you mean, cop out?

1964
01:36:02,745 --> 01:36:04,582
What's wrong with layin' brick?

1965
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:05,462
-Nothing.

1966
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:07,803
There's nothin' wrong. That's
somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1967
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:10,197
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?

1968
01:36:10,805 --> 01:36:12,534
Busted his ass so I
could have an education.

1969
01:36:12,595 --> 01:36:14,192
Exactly. That's an
honourable profession.

1970
01:36:14,253 --> 01:36:16,172
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

1971
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:17,704
Someone will get to work
the next day because of me.

1972
01:36:17,777 --> 01:36:18,881
That's honour in that.

1973
01:36:18,942 --> 01:36:20,458
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honour in that.

1974
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:23,039
There's honour in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1975
01:36:23,259 --> 01:36:24,455
so those college
kids could come in

1976
01:36:24,516 --> 01:36:25,607
in the morning and
their floors are clean.

1977
01:36:25,681 --> 01:36:27,571
And their waste baskets are empty.
That's real work.

1978
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:28,265
That's right.

1979
01:36:28,326 --> 01:36:29,671
And that's honourable.

1980
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:31,618
I'm sure that's why
you took that job.

1981
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:32,995
I mean, for the honour of it.

1982
01:36:33,977 --> 01:36:35,388
I just have a little
question here.

1983
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:37,750
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1984
01:36:38,731 --> 01:36:40,554
Why did you work at
the most prestigious

1985
01:36:40,615 --> 01:36:42,594
technical college in
the whole fuckin' world?

1986
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,781
Why did you sneak
around at night

1987
01:36:44,842 --> 01:36:45,921
and finish other
people's formulas...

1988
01:36:45,982 --> 01:36:47,471
that only one or two
people in the world

1989
01:36:47,532 --> 01:36:49,012
could do and then lie about it?

1990
01:36:52,451 --> 01:36:54,401
'Cause I don't see a lot
of honour in that, Will.

1991
01:36:58,084 --> 01:36:59,329
So what do you really wanna do?

1992
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:05,840
I wanna be a shepherd.

1993
01:37:06,316 --> 01:37:06,959
Really?

1994
01:37:07,802 --> 01:37:10,010
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread,

1995
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:11,598
get some sheep and tend to them.

1996
01:37:12,157 --> 01:37:13,659
Maybe you should go do that.

1997
01:37:13,805 --> 01:37:14,641
What?

1998
01:37:15,067 --> 01:37:16,368
You know, if you're
gonna jerk off,

1999
01:37:16,429 --> 01:37:17,952
why don't you just do it
at home with a moist towel?

2000
01:37:18,013 --> 01:37:19,645
-You're chuckin' me?
-Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

2001
01:37:19,706 --> 01:37:21,882
-No, no, no, time's not up yet.
-Yeah, it is.

2002
01:37:21,943 --> 01:37:22,698
I'm not leavin'. No.

2003
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:24,881
You're not gonna answer,
you're wastin' my time.

2004
01:37:24,942 --> 01:37:26,696
I thought we were friends.
What do you mean...

2005
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:27,701
Playtime's over, okay?

2006
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:30,090
Why are you kickin' me out, Sean?
I mean...

2007
01:37:30,648 --> 01:37:32,124
You're lecturin' me on life?

2008
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:34,072
Look at you, you
fuckin' burnout.

2009
01:37:34,192 --> 01:37:35,593
What winds your clock?

2010
01:37:35,754 --> 01:37:36,589
Workin' with you.

2011
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:37,748
Where's your soul mate?

2012
01:37:37,809 --> 01:37:39,693
You wanna talk about soul mates?
Where is she?

2013
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:41,914
-Dead.
-That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

2014
01:37:41,975 --> 01:37:43,392
She fuckin' dies
and you just cash

2015
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:44,804
in your chips and you walk away?

2016
01:37:44,944 --> 01:37:46,077
At least I played a hand.

2017
01:37:46,138 --> 01:37:47,697
You played a hand and you lost.

2018
01:37:47,758 --> 01:37:48,827
You lost a big fuckin' hand.

2019
01:37:48,888 --> 01:37:50,488
Some people will lose
a big hand like that

2020
01:37:50,549 --> 01:37:51,998
and have the sack
to ante up again.

2021
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:53,158
Look at me.

2022
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,241
What do you wanna do?

2023
01:38:02,413 --> 01:38:03,580
You and your bullshit.

2024
01:38:04,266 --> 01:38:06,017
You got a bullshit
answer for everybody.

2025
01:38:06,609 --> 01:38:08,440
But I ask you a
very simple question

2026
01:38:08,538 --> 01:38:10,302
and you can't give
me a straight answer,

2027
01:38:12,035 --> 01:38:13,187
because you don't know.

2028
01:38:15,989 --> 01:38:17,047
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

2029
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:22,928
-Fuck you.
-You're the shepherd.

2030
01:38:28,122 --> 01:38:29,215
Shepherd.

2031
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:31,938
White little prick.

2032
01:38:33,932 --> 01:38:35,635
I just wanted to, you know, um,

2033
01:38:35,793 --> 01:38:39,277
call you up, uh,
before you left, um...

2034
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,739
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

2035
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,760
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

2036
01:38:43,957 --> 01:38:46,620
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

2037
01:38:48,364 --> 01:38:49,100
Yeah.

2038
01:38:53,598 --> 01:38:54,468
I love you.

2039
01:39:00,074 --> 01:39:00,714
Will?

2040
01:39:03,845 --> 01:39:04,616
You take care.

2041
01:39:09,256 --> 01:39:09,949
Bye.

2042
01:40:16,994 --> 01:40:17,607
Will!

2043
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:22,016
Will, that's it! We're done!

2044
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:25,056
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

2045
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:28,352
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

2046
01:40:29,769 --> 01:40:31,714
An hour and ten minutes late.

2047
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:36,298
Well, if he doesn't show up

2048
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:37,992
and I file a report
saying he wasn't here...

2049
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:40,480
and he goes back to jail, he
won't be on my conscience.

2050
01:40:45,197 --> 01:40:45,850
Okay.

2051
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:47,477
Fine.

2052
01:40:50,184 --> 01:40:50,948
What's up?

2053
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:54,189
Thanks.

2054
01:40:58,124 --> 01:40:58,714
Ah!

2055
01:40:58,905 --> 01:41:01,025
God, that's good.

2056
01:41:05,988 --> 01:41:06,901
So how's your lady?

2057
01:41:08,372 --> 01:41:09,437
Ah, she's gone.

2058
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:12,513
Gone? Gone where?

2059
01:41:13,989 --> 01:41:14,846
Med school.

2060
01:41:15,122 --> 01:41:16,634
Medical school in California.

2061
01:41:18,175 --> 01:41:19,156
-Really?
-Yeah.

2062
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,040
When was this?

2063
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:21,634
It was, like, a week ago.

2064
01:41:26,842 --> 01:41:27,834
That sucks.

2065
01:41:31,718 --> 01:41:33,443
So, uh, when are you
done with those meetings?

2066
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:37,182
I think the week after I'm 21.

2067
01:41:37,313 --> 01:41:39,346
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

2068
01:41:40,217 --> 01:41:42,142
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room

2069
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:44,218
and do long division
for the next 50 years.

2070
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,955
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

2071
01:41:47,989 --> 01:41:49,821
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

2072
01:41:49,968 --> 01:41:50,912
Better than this shit.

2073
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:52,357
Way outta here.

2074
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,536
What do I want a
way outta here for?

2075
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:57,556
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

2076
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:00,317
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

2077
01:42:00,378 --> 01:42:02,882
Fuckin' take 'em to Little
League together up Foley Field.

2078
01:42:06,517 --> 01:42:09,470
Look, you're my best friend, so
don't take this the wrong way.

2079
01:42:10,016 --> 01:42:12,608
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

2080
01:42:13,034 --> 01:42:14,993
comin' over to my house to
watch the Patriots games,

2081
01:42:15,054 --> 01:42:17,348
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

2082
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:20,980
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

2083
01:42:21,378 --> 01:42:22,630
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

2084
01:42:23,516 --> 01:42:24,106
Look,

2085
01:42:24,724 --> 01:42:26,254
you got something
none of us have.

2086
01:42:26,315 --> 01:42:27,827
Oh, come on! Why
is it always this?

2087
01:42:27,888 --> 01:42:29,889
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to
myself to do this or that.

2088
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:30,666
What if I don't want to?

2089
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:33,777
No, no, no. Fuck you. You
don't owe it to yourself.

2090
01:42:34,984 --> 01:42:35,879
You owe it to me,

2091
01:42:37,255 --> 01:42:39,302
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

2092
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,563
and I'll still be
doin' this shit.

2093
01:42:42,821 --> 01:42:44,337
That's all right. That's fine.

2094
01:42:44,922 --> 01:42:46,689
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

2095
01:42:47,697 --> 01:42:49,543
You're too much of a
pussy to cash it in,

2096
01:42:50,406 --> 01:42:51,281
and that's bullshit.

2097
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:56,015
'Cause I'd do fuckin'
anything to have what you got.

2098
01:42:56,376 --> 01:42:58,339
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

2099
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,858
Be an insult to us if you're
still here in 20 years.

2100
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:04,112
Hangin' around here is a
fuckin' waste of your time.

2101
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:06,878
-You don't know that.
-I don't?

2102
01:43:06,991 --> 01:43:08,906
-No. You don't know that.
-Oh, I don't know that.

2103
01:43:09,164 --> 01:43:10,242
Let me tell you what I do know.

2104
01:43:11,223 --> 01:43:13,726
Every day I come by your
house, and I pick you up.

2105
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:16,119
We go out and have a few drinks

2106
01:43:16,262 --> 01:43:17,929
and few laughs, and it's great.

2107
01:43:18,552 --> 01:43:20,233
You know what the best
part of my day is?

2108
01:43:21,346 --> 01:43:22,450
It's for about ten seconds:

2109
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:25,125
from when I pull up to the curb
and when I get to your door.

2110
01:43:25,689 --> 01:43:27,073
'Cause I think maybe
I'll get up there

2111
01:43:27,134 --> 01:43:28,798
and I'll knock on the door
and you won't be there.

2112
01:43:30,602 --> 01:43:32,760
No 'good-bye', no 'see ya later'.
No nothing.

2113
01:43:33,103 --> 01:43:33,810
You just left.

2114
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:37,533
I don't know much,
but I know that.

2115
01:43:50,957 --> 01:43:52,477
This is a disaster, Sean.

2116
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:54,438
I brought you in here because

2117
01:43:54,499 --> 01:43:55,980
I wanted you to help
me with the boy,

2118
01:43:56,177 --> 01:43:57,864
-not to run him out.
-I know what I'm doing with the boy.

2119
01:43:57,925 --> 01:43:59,588
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

2120
01:43:59,672 --> 01:44:01,727
I don't care if you have a few
laughs, even at my expense.

2121
01:44:01,788 --> 01:44:04,210
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

2122
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:04,980
Undermine?

2123
01:44:05,863 --> 01:44:07,462
This boy is at a
fragile point right now.

2124
01:44:07,523 --> 01:44:10,727
I do understand. He is at a fragile point.
Okay? He's got problems.

2125
01:44:10,788 --> 01:44:12,064
What problems does
he have, Sean?

2126
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:14,744
That he's better off as a janitor,
that he is better off in jail?

2127
01:44:14,805 --> 01:44:17,367
Better hanging out with a
bunch of retarded gorillas?

2128
01:44:17,428 --> 01:44:19,503
Why do you think he
does that, Gerry?

2129
01:44:19,564 --> 01:44:21,052
You have any fuckin' clue why?

2130
01:44:21,559 --> 01:44:22,734
He can handle the problems.

2131
01:44:22,795 --> 01:44:25,207
He can handle the work.
He obviously handled you.

2132
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:27,453
Gerry, Listen. Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?

2133
01:44:27,514 --> 01:44:28,875
Why doesn't he trust anybody?

2134
01:44:29,231 --> 01:44:30,656
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

2135
01:44:30,717 --> 01:44:31,956
he was abandoned by the people

2136
01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:33,146
who were supposed to
love him the most.

2137
01:44:33,213 --> 01:44:34,703
Come on. Don't give
me that Freudian crap.

2138
01:44:34,764 --> 01:44:36,377
Oh, no. Listen Gerry,
why does he hang out with those

2139
01:44:36,438 --> 01:44:37,987
retarded gorillas,
as you call them?

2140
01:44:38,223 --> 01:44:40,002
Because any one of them,
if he asked them to,

2141
01:44:40,063 --> 01:44:41,893
would take a fucking
bat to your head. Okay?

2142
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,249
-That's called loyalty.
-Yeah, that's very touching.

2143
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:45,128
And, who's he handling?

2144
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,753
He pushes people away

2145
01:44:46,814 --> 01:44:48,429
before they have a
chance to leave him.

2146
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:50,478
It's a defence
mechanism, all right?

2147
01:44:50,628 --> 01:44:53,038
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

2148
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:55,004
If you push him right now,

2149
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:56,315
it's gonna be the same
thing all over again.

2150
01:44:56,376 --> 01:44:58,328
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

2151
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,030
-Don't you do that, Sean.
-What?

2152
01:45:00,113 --> 01:45:02,081
Don't you do that. Don't
infect him with the idea

2153
01:45:02,142 --> 01:45:04,686
that it's okay to quit, that
it's okay to be a failure.

2154
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,912
Because it's not okay, Sean!

2155
01:45:06,267 --> 01:45:08,562
And if you're angry at
me for being successful,

2156
01:45:08,623 --> 01:45:09,827
for being what you
could have been...

2157
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,669
-I'm not angry at you.
-Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

2158
01:45:12,953 --> 01:45:14,100
You resent me,

2159
01:45:14,473 --> 01:45:17,574
but I'm not gonna apologize
for any success I've had.

2160
01:45:18,114 --> 01:45:19,898
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

2161
01:45:19,959 --> 01:45:21,157
But ask yourself,
Sean, ask yourself...

2162
01:45:21,737 --> 01:45:24,059
ask yourself, if you want
Will to feel that way,

2163
01:45:24,406 --> 01:45:25,969
if you want him to
feel like a failure?

2164
01:45:26,262 --> 01:45:27,477
You arrogant shit!

2165
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:29,965
That's why I don't come
to the goddamn reunions,

2166
01:45:30,478 --> 01:45:32,312
'cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

2167
01:45:32,738 --> 01:45:34,572
You know, that condescending,
embarrassed look.

2168
01:45:34,633 --> 01:45:35,467
Oh, come on, Sean.

2169
01:45:35,528 --> 01:45:37,775
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

2170
01:45:37,836 --> 01:45:39,187
I'm proud of what I do.

2171
01:45:39,317 --> 01:45:41,784
It was a conscious choice.
I didn't fuck up!

2172
01:45:42,519 --> 01:45:44,766
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

2173
01:45:45,073 --> 01:45:46,475
You and your kiss-ass chorus

2174
01:45:46,695 --> 01:45:48,831
following you around going, 'The
Field's medal!', The Field's Medal!'

2175
01:45:48,959 --> 01:45:51,712
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

2176
01:45:51,795 --> 01:45:53,687
It's about my medal, isn't it?

2177
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:55,906
Oh, God, I could go home and get it for you.
You can have it.

2178
01:45:55,973 --> 01:45:57,384
Oh, please don't. You know what!

2179
01:45:57,452 --> 01:45:59,238
Shove the medal up your
fuckin' ass, all right?

2180
01:45:59,299 --> 01:46:00,762
'Cause I don't give a
shit about your medal,

2181
01:46:00,823 --> 01:46:03,641
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

2182
01:46:03,934 --> 01:46:05,494
when you were
pimple-faced and homesick

2183
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:06,793
and didn't know what side
of the bed to piss on.

2184
01:46:06,854 --> 01:46:07,892
Yeah, you were
smarter than me then

2185
01:46:07,953 --> 01:46:09,234
and you're smarter than me now.

2186
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:11,328
So don't blame me for how your
life turned out. It's not my fault.

2187
01:46:11,389 --> 01:46:13,814
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

2188
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:15,166
You mathematical dick!

2189
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:16,599
It's about the boy!

2190
01:46:16,885 --> 01:46:19,666
He's a good kid! And I
won't see you fuck him up

2191
01:46:19,784 --> 01:46:21,579
like you're tryin' to
fuck up me right now.

2192
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,870
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

2193
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:25,490
He won't be a failure!

2194
01:46:25,557 --> 01:46:28,292
But if you push him, Gerry,
if you ride him...

2195
01:46:28,433 --> 01:46:31,417
I am what I am today
because I was pushed

2196
01:46:31,478 --> 01:46:33,006
and because I learned
to push myself.

2197
01:46:33,067 --> 01:46:34,453
He's not you! You get that!

2198
01:46:38,688 --> 01:46:40,275
-I can come back.
-No, come in. Uh...

2199
01:46:41,138 --> 01:46:42,130
I was just leaving.

2200
01:46:53,888 --> 01:46:56,730
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

2201
01:46:57,682 --> 01:46:58,449
You know.

2202
01:46:59,016 --> 01:46:59,839
Not about you.

2203
01:47:05,392 --> 01:47:06,378
What is that?

2204
01:47:07,192 --> 01:47:08,087
This is your file.

2205
01:47:08,499 --> 01:47:10,757
I have to send it back to
the judge for evaluation.

2206
01:47:11,223 --> 01:47:11,699
Oh.

2207
01:47:14,236 --> 01:47:15,492
Hey, you're not gonna
fail me, are you?

2208
01:47:20,095 --> 01:47:20,941
What's it say?

2209
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:24,077
Wanna read it?

2210
01:47:24,729 --> 01:47:25,437
Why?

2211
01:47:28,572 --> 01:47:29,623
Have you had any, uh,

2212
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:31,414
experience with that?

2213
01:47:31,759 --> 01:47:32,788
Twenty years of counselling.

2214
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:34,491
Yeah, I've seen some
pretty awful shit.

2215
01:47:35,767 --> 01:47:36,856
I mean, have you had any

2216
01:47:37,982 --> 01:47:39,067
experience with that?

2217
01:47:43,281 --> 01:47:43,975
Personally?

2218
01:47:45,721 --> 01:47:46,308
Yeah.

2219
01:47:47,126 --> 01:47:47,956
Yeah, I have.

2220
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:50,473
It sure ain't good.

2221
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:56,285
My father was an alcoholic.

2222
01:47:57,039 --> 01:47:58,488
Mean fuckin' drunk.

2223
01:48:00,862 --> 01:48:01,808
He'd come home hammered,

2224
01:48:01,869 --> 01:48:03,373
lookin' to whale on somebody.

2225
01:48:03,915 --> 01:48:05,450
So I'd provoke him so he

2226
01:48:05,786 --> 01:48:07,444
wouldn't go after my
mother and little brother.

2227
01:48:09,448 --> 01:48:11,537
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

2228
01:48:14,169 --> 01:48:15,668
-Yeah.
-He used to just put a...

2229
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:19,055
a wrench, a stick and a belt

2230
01:48:19,388 --> 01:48:21,522
on the table. Just
say, 'Choose'.

2231
01:48:22,742 --> 01:48:23,915
Well, I gotta go
with the belt there.

2232
01:48:23,976 --> 01:48:25,937
I used to go with the wrench.

2233
01:48:26,688 --> 01:48:27,541
Why the wrench?

2234
01:48:28,673 --> 01:48:30,101
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

2235
01:48:30,857 --> 01:48:31,749
Your foster father?

2236
01:48:32,593 --> 01:48:33,228
Yeah.

2237
01:48:34,306 --> 01:48:35,991
So, uh, what is it, like,

2238
01:48:36,589 --> 01:48:39,401
Will has an attachment disorder?
Is it all that stuff?

2239
01:48:41,288 --> 01:48:42,274
Fear of abandonment?

2240
01:48:43,969 --> 01:48:44,775
Is that why I...

2241
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:46,848
Is that why I broke
up with Skylar?

2242
01:48:47,535 --> 01:48:48,520
I didn't know you had.

2243
01:48:48,838 --> 01:48:49,556
Yeah, I did.

2244
01:48:50,758 --> 01:48:52,380
-You wanna talk about it?
-No.

2245
01:48:56,638 --> 01:48:57,398
Hey, Will,

2246
01:48:59,318 --> 01:49:00,420
I don't know a lot.

2247
01:49:02,747 --> 01:49:03,585
You see this?

2248
01:49:04,502 --> 01:49:05,485
All this shit?

2249
01:49:10,873 --> 01:49:12,137
It's not your fault.

2250
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:16,581
Yeah, I know that.

2251
01:49:17,393 --> 01:49:18,355
Look at me, son.

2252
01:49:20,695 --> 01:49:21,689
It's not your fault.

2253
01:49:22,969 --> 01:49:23,708
I know.

2254
01:49:24,092 --> 01:49:24,778
No.

2255
01:49:25,288 --> 01:49:26,500
It's not your fault.

2256
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:30,920
I know.

2257
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,039
No, no, you don't.

2258
01:49:32,606 --> 01:49:33,739
It's not your fault.

2259
01:49:36,586 --> 01:49:37,478
I know.

2260
01:49:37,539 --> 01:49:38,488
It's not your fault.

2261
01:49:38,762 --> 01:49:39,486
All right.

2262
01:49:39,935 --> 01:49:41,277
It's not your fault.

2263
01:49:44,559 --> 01:49:45,880
It's not your fault.

2264
01:49:46,264 --> 01:49:47,446
Don't fuck with me.

2265
01:49:51,306 --> 01:49:52,369
It's not your fault.

2266
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:54,294
Don't fuck with me, all right?

2267
01:49:54,355 --> 01:49:55,619
Don't fuck with
me, Sean, not you.

2268
01:49:55,703 --> 01:49:57,062
It's not your fault.

2269
01:50:04,019 --> 01:50:05,003
It's not your fault.

2270
01:50:14,147 --> 01:50:15,427
My God...

2271
01:50:17,333 --> 01:50:20,561
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

2272
01:50:35,814 --> 01:50:36,975
Fuck them, okay?

2273
01:52:04,182 --> 01:52:05,015
Can I help you?

2274
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,818
Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.
I'm here about a position.

2275
01:52:08,481 --> 01:52:09,889
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

2276
01:52:14,042 --> 01:52:16,548
Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting
in the lobby.

2277
01:52:38,439 --> 01:52:39,279
Which one did you take?

2278
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:41,733
I was over at McNeil.

2279
01:52:41,794 --> 01:52:44,149
It's one of the jobs the
professor set me up with.

2280
01:52:45,185 --> 01:52:46,534
I haven't told him yet,

2281
01:52:46,595 --> 01:52:49,143
but I went down there
and talked to my boss...

2282
01:52:49,447 --> 01:52:51,360
My new boss. He seemed
like a good guy.

2283
01:52:52,934 --> 01:52:53,905
Is that what you want?

2284
01:52:55,594 --> 01:52:57,115
Yeah, you know, I think so.

2285
01:52:58,450 --> 01:53:01,198
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

2286
01:53:01,614 --> 01:53:02,370
Thanks.

2287
01:53:06,714 --> 01:53:07,503
Time's up.

2288
01:53:11,604 --> 01:53:14,098
So that's... so that's it?
So we're done?

2289
01:53:14,797 --> 01:53:15,523
Yeah, that's it.

2290
01:53:17,609 --> 01:53:18,278
You're done.

2291
01:53:18,696 --> 01:53:19,645
You're a free man.

2292
01:53:21,739 --> 01:53:22,853
Well, um,

2293
01:53:24,241 --> 01:53:26,534
I just want you to
know, Sean, that...

2294
01:53:26,595 --> 01:53:27,550
You're welcome, Will.

2295
01:53:33,947 --> 01:53:36,993
So, you know, I hope we
keep in touch, you know.

2296
01:53:37,434 --> 01:53:38,274
Yeah, me too.

2297
01:53:39,485 --> 01:53:40,925
I'll be travelin' around a bit.

2298
01:53:40,986 --> 01:53:42,166
It'll be a little
hard, but, uh...

2299
01:53:42,246 --> 01:53:43,731
I've got an answering machine

2300
01:53:43,822 --> 01:53:45,439
at the college I'll
be checking in with.

2301
01:53:48,702 --> 01:53:49,577
So, here's the number.

2302
01:53:49,638 --> 01:53:51,980
You call that. I'll get
back to you right away.

2303
01:53:53,843 --> 01:53:56,481
Yeah, you know, I
figured I'm just gonna...

2304
01:53:56,801 --> 01:53:58,111
put my money back on the table

2305
01:53:58,172 --> 01:53:59,656
and see what kind
of cards I get.

2306
01:54:02,765 --> 01:54:04,761
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

2307
01:54:10,336 --> 01:54:11,543
Thank you, Sean.

2308
01:54:12,862 --> 01:54:13,809
Thank you, Will.

2309
01:54:16,303 --> 01:54:19,242
Hey, does this violate the
patient-doctor relationship?

2310
01:54:19,613 --> 01:54:21,502
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

2311
01:54:25,577 --> 01:54:26,217
Take care.

2312
01:54:27,204 --> 01:54:27,806
You too.

2313
01:54:27,902 --> 01:54:28,591
Yeah.

2314
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:31,605
Hey.

2315
01:54:34,028 --> 01:54:34,897
Good luck, son.

2316
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:48,080
Two beers.

2317
01:54:53,774 --> 01:54:54,751
What's up? Did you guys go?

2318
01:54:54,812 --> 01:54:56,343
No. I had to talk him down.

2319
01:54:56,909 --> 01:54:58,022
Why didn't you yoke him?

2320
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:00,621
Little Morgan's got a
lot of scrap to him.

2321
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,818
People try to whip
his ass every week.

2322
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:04,340
Fuckin' kid won't back down.

2323
01:55:04,407 --> 01:55:05,401
What are you sayin' about me?

2324
01:55:05,588 --> 01:55:06,661
Was I talkin' to you?

2325
01:55:07,624 --> 01:55:08,713
None of your fuckin' business.

2326
01:55:09,932 --> 01:55:12,050
-Go get me a beer.
-I ordered two beers!

2327
01:55:12,746 --> 01:55:14,748
-Hey, ass hole.
-What, bitch?

2328
01:55:14,809 --> 01:55:15,725
Happy birthday.

2329
01:55:15,995 --> 01:55:17,396
Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

2330
01:55:17,711 --> 01:55:20,470
-Come on!
-I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

2331
01:55:21,522 --> 01:55:22,687
All right. Who's first?

2332
01:55:23,012 --> 01:55:25,432
-Come on, mother fucker!
-Who's first?

2333
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:29,193
Here's your present.

2334
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:32,360
-Come on, bro.
-What?

2335
01:55:32,881 --> 01:55:34,789
Well, we knew you
had to get back

2336
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:37,097
and forth to Cambridge
for your new job.

2337
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:39,963
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so...

2338
01:55:41,829 --> 01:55:43,215
Morgan wanted to
get you a 'T' pass.

2339
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,569
That's not what I was sayin'!

2340
01:55:45,462 --> 01:55:46,408
But, uh,

2341
01:55:47,081 --> 01:55:47,840
you're 21 now.

2342
01:55:47,923 --> 01:55:49,429
You're legally allowed to drink,

2343
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:51,644
so we figured the best
thing for ya was a car.

2344
01:55:51,705 --> 01:55:52,396
How do you like it?

2345
01:55:53,116 --> 01:55:53,876
This is like...

2346
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:59,184
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

2347
01:56:01,319 --> 01:56:03,307
-Come on, brother.
-How'd you guys do this?

2348
01:56:04,167 --> 01:56:04,828
You know,

2349
01:56:05,155 --> 01:56:07,459
me and Bill scraped
together the parts, and...

2350
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:10,094
Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

2351
01:56:10,155 --> 01:56:11,796
I had the router to
do all the bodywork.

2352
01:56:11,857 --> 01:56:13,385
Yeah, I have a fuckin'
job, too, brother.

2353
01:56:13,446 --> 01:56:14,516
Guy's been up my
ass for two years

2354
01:56:14,577 --> 01:56:16,185
about a job. I had to let
him help with the car.

2355
01:56:16,246 --> 01:56:18,149
So you finally got
a job, huh, Morgan?

2356
01:56:18,214 --> 01:56:20,181
Yeah, had one. Now
I'm fucked again.

2357
01:56:20,357 --> 01:56:22,642
So what is it? A lawn mower?
What do ya got?

2358
01:56:22,703 --> 01:56:23,859
It's a straight fuckin' six.

2359
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,881
Me and Bill rebuilt this
engine ourselves here.

2360
01:56:25,942 --> 01:56:28,617
It's a good car. The engine's good.
Engine's good.

2361
01:56:29,953 --> 01:56:31,058
Happy 21, Will.

2362
01:56:32,271 --> 01:56:33,237
Happy 21, brother.

2363
01:56:41,752 --> 01:56:42,367
Hi.

2364
01:56:43,948 --> 01:56:44,715
Come on in.

2365
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:50,140
Sean, I, um...

2366
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:51,493
Me too, Gerry.

2367
01:56:53,011 --> 01:56:53,996
Yeah. Good.

2368
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:58,292
I heard you're takin' some time.

2369
01:56:58,376 --> 01:56:59,061
Yeah.

2370
01:56:59,407 --> 01:57:01,084
Travel a little bit,

2371
01:57:01,664 --> 01:57:02,633
maybe write.

2372
01:57:03,322 --> 01:57:04,135
So where are you going?

2373
01:57:04,978 --> 01:57:05,949
India and...

2374
01:57:06,522 --> 01:57:07,366
China...

2375
01:57:07,952 --> 01:57:08,913
and Baltimore.

2376
01:57:12,774 --> 01:57:13,907
You know when you'll be back?

2377
01:57:14,285 --> 01:57:14,937
Oh.

2378
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:17,961
I got this flyer the other day.

2379
01:57:18,411 --> 01:57:21,372
It says, uh, class of '72 is
having a reunion in six months.

2380
01:57:21,433 --> 01:57:22,860
Yeah, I got one of those too.

2381
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:24,863
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

2382
01:57:26,112 --> 01:57:27,825
The drinks at those
things are free.

2383
01:57:29,361 --> 01:57:31,370
I know, Gerry. I
was being ironical.

2384
01:57:38,724 --> 01:57:40,246
How about a drink right now?

2385
01:57:41,338 --> 01:57:42,799
Yeah. It's a good idea.

2386
01:57:43,187 --> 01:57:44,700
Come on. This one's on me.

2387
01:57:48,339 --> 01:57:50,285
I got the winner
right here, pal.

2388
01:57:50,507 --> 01:57:52,509
Yes, sir, this is the one.

2389
01:57:54,146 --> 01:57:56,073
This is my ticket to paradise.

2390
01:57:56,134 --> 01:57:57,384
Sean, do you know
what the odds are

2391
01:57:57,445 --> 01:57:58,533
against winning the lottery?

2392
01:57:58,594 --> 01:58:01,425
-What? Four to one?
-About 30 million to one.

2393
01:58:01,817 --> 01:58:03,138
I still have a shot, you know?

2394
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:04,522
Yes,

2395
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:07,111
just about as big
chance as you being hit

2396
01:58:07,172 --> 01:58:09,406
by lightning here on
the staircase right now.

2397
01:58:09,467 --> 01:58:11,271
It's a possibility too. I mean,

2398
01:58:11,332 --> 01:58:12,852
32 million. If you
look at the size...

2399
01:59:42,633 --> 01:59:43,373
Will!

2400
02:00:04,073 --> 02:00:04,581
Will?

2401
02:01:13,917 --> 02:01:14,783
He's not there.

2402
02:01:36,508 --> 02:01:37,501
Sean,

2403
02:01:37,948 --> 02:01:39,818
if the professor
calls about that job,

2404
02:01:39,879 --> 02:01:41,248
